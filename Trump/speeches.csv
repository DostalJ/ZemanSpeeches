It’s great to have you at the White House.  And I just wanted to pass on word -- Otto Warmbier has just passed away.  He spent a year and a half in North Korea.  A lot of bad things happened.  But at least we got him home to be with his parents, where they were so happy to see him, even though he was in very tough condition.  But he just passed away a little while ago.  It’s a brutal regime, and we’ll be able to handle it.But I want to thank you all for being here, special people.  I’m really thrilled to welcome many of you for the first time, and certainly the first time meeting as the American Technology Council.  We’re joined by an incredible group of leaders on the absolute cutting edge of innovation, including many CEOs from the world’s most successful businesses.We have approximately $3.5 trillion of market value in this room -- but that’s almost the exact number that we’ve created since my election.  (Laughter.)  In fact, I think we have you beat by a little bit, which is a pretty good number.  But I congratulate you all.  Done an amazing job.  Thank you for lending your time and your talent to the American people.  A lot of ideas have come out of the room today, and a lot of ideas will over the next short period of time.I also want to welcome Secretary Mnuchin, Secretary Kelly, Administrator Verma, and my Budget Director, Mick Mulvaney.  Thank you all.  Done a great job.  I want to thank Jared and Chris -- Chris Liddell -- for assembling such a spectacular group of people.  They’re working very, very hard.  I want to thank Ivanka for working so hard on it; it’s a real passion.  Our goal is to lead a sweeping transformation of the federal government’s technology that will deliver dramatically better services for citizens, stronger protection from cyberattacks -- which we were just discussing in the Oval Office with a little bit smaller group.  That’s a big problem, there’s no question about it.  We’re going to be working on it and we’re going to solve the problem -- and up to a trillion dollars in savings for taxpayers over the next 10 years.  Over a trillion.We’re embracing big change, bold thinking, and outsider perspectives to transform government and make it the way it should be, and at far less cost.  My administration has already taken very historic steps to modernize critical IT systems and make government more transparent.  As an example, you’re seeing what we’re doing with the airports, with all of the billions and billions of dollars that have been spent on planes flying all in the wrong directions -- we’re getting a change.  They’ve spent many billions of dollars, and we are getting that whole system fixed.  Money wasted over the last six or seven years -- billions.VA Secretary Shulkin recently announced that we’re upgrading technology to allow the seamless transfer of veterans’ medical records from the Defense Department, which has been a huge problem for decades and decades for our great veterans.  We’ll have it fixed very soon, but it’s been a problem for many, many decades.  Across government, we’re fixing problems in months that others have not fixed in many, many years.  And we’re just getting started.Fifty years ago, our government drove the innovation that inspired the world and put Americans on the moon.  Today, many of our agencies rely on painfully outdated technology, and yet, we have the greatest people in technology that the world has ever seen right here with us in this room.  And most of them are just nodding as I say that.  They’re actually agreeing with me, which -- (laughter) -- that’s interesting, Eric, right?  Government needs to catch up with the technology revolution.  We’re going to change that with the help of great American businesses like the people assembled.  The businesses represented here today employ hundreds of thousands of American workers.  Your innovation has shaped the modern world and created millions of jobs.  America should be the global leader in government technology just as we are in every other aspect, and we are going to start our big edge again in technology -– such an important industry.  I view it from the standpoint of jobs and other things; you view it somewhat differently.  But we’re all in the same ballpark.  It’s so important.  So important.My administration is embracing a new spirit of innovation that will make life better for all Americans.  And when it comes to what we’re here for today, American technology, we’re working very diligently with everybody, including Congress, on immigration so that you can get the people you want in your companies.  And it’s been a tremendous problem that you’ve had over the past long period of time.  So we’re working very hard on that and we’ll be able to solve that problem.I want to than"

2017-06-16;https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/06/16/remarks-president-trump-policy-united-states-towards-cuba;Remarks by President Trump on the Policy of the United States Towards Cuba;"Thank you, everybody.  Thank you very much.  Great honor.  And thank you to my truly great friend, Vice President Mike Pence -- he’s terrific.  (Applause.)  And thank you to Miami.  We love Miami.  Let me start by saying that I’m glad Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and I, along with a very talented team, were able to get Otto Warmbier back with his parents.  (Applause.)  What’s happened to him is a truly terrible thing, but at least the ones who love him so much can now take care of him and be with him.Also, my dear friend, Steve Scalise, took a bullet for all of us.  And because of him, and the tremendous pain and suffering he’s now enduring -- he’s having a hard time, far worse than anybody thought -- our country will perhaps become closer, more unified.  So important.  So we all owe Steve a big, big thank you.  And let’s keep the Warmbier family, and the Scalise family, and all of the victims of the congressional shooting, in our hearts and prayers.  And it was quite a day and our police officers were incredible, weren’t they?  They did a great job.  (Applause.)    And let us all pray for a future of peace, unity and safety for all of our people.  (Applause.)  Thank you.  And for Cuba.I am so thrilled to be back here with all of my friends in Little Havana.  (Applause.)  I love it.  I love this city.  AUDIENCE MEMBER:  We love you?THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  Thank you. This is an amazing community, the Cuban-American community -- so much love.  I saw that immediately.AUDIENCE MEMBER:  We love you!THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, darling.  Oh do I love you, too.  (Applause.)    What you have built here -- a vibrant culture, a thriving neighborhood, the spirit of adventure -- is a testament to what a free Cuba could be.  And with God’s help, a free Cuba is what we will soon achieve.  (Applause.)   AUDIENCE:  USA! USA! USA!THE PRESIDENT:  And I don’t even mind that it is 110 degrees up here.  (Laughter.)  This room is packed.  You know, it wasn’t designed for this.  I would like to thank the fire department.  (Laughter.)  We are delighted to be joined by so many friends and leaders of our great community.  I want to express our deep gratitude to a man who has really become a friend of mine -- and I want to tell you, he is one tough competitor -- Senator Marco Rubio.  (Applause.)  Great guy.  (Applause.)  He is tough, man.  He is tough and he’s good, and he loves you.  He loves you.And I listened to another friend of mine, Congressman Mario Diaz-Balart -- (applause) -- and I’ll tell you, I loved what he said, and I appreciate it.  Mario, I appreciated what you said so much.  In fact I was looking for Mario.  I wanted to find him -- they said he was onstage.  I almost dragged him off the stage to thank him, but now I’m thanking you anyway.  Thank you, Mario.  That was great.  Really appreciate it.  And I also want to thank my good friend, and just a man who was of tremendous support in the state of Florida, for being with us -- Governor Rick Scott.  (Applause.)  Great job.  He’s doing a great job.  I hope he runs for the Senate.  I know I’m not supposed to say that.  I hope he runs for the Senate.  Rick, are you running?  (Applause.)  I don’t know.  Marco, let’s go, come on.  We got to get him to -- I hope he runs for the Senate. We are deeply honored to be joined by amazing Veterans of the Bay of Pigs.  (Applause.)  These are great people, amazing people.  (Applause.)    I have wonderful memories from our visit during the campaign.  That was some visit.  That was right before the election.  I guess it worked, right?  Boy, Florida, as a whole, and this community supported us by tremendous margins.  We appreciate it.  But including one of the big honors, and that was the honor of getting the Bay of Pigs award just before the election, and it’s great to be gathered in a place named for a true hero of the Cuban people.  And you know what that means.  (Applause.)   I was also looking forward to welcoming today two people who are not present -- José Daniel Ferrer and Berta Soler -- (applause) -- were both prevented from leaving Cuba for this event.  So we acknowledge them.  They’re great friends -- great help.  And although they could not be with us, we are with them 100 percent.  (Applause.)  We are with them.  Right?Finally, I want to recognize everyone in the audience who has their own painful but important story to tell about the true and brutal nature of the Castro regime.  Brutal.  We thank the dissidents, the exiles, and the children of Operation Peter Pan -- you know what that means -- (applause) -- and all who gather in the cafes, churches, and the streets in this incredible area and city to speak the truth and to stand for justice.  (Applause.)    And we want to thank you all for being a voice for the voiceless.  There are people –- it’s voiceless, but you are making up the difference, and we all want to thank you.  This group is amazing.  Just an incredible –- you are an incredible group of talented, passionate people.  Thank you.  Incredible group of people.    Many of you witnessed terrible crimes committed in service of a depraved ideology.  You saw the dreams of generations held by captive, and just, literally, you look at what happened and what communism has done.  You knew faces that disappeared, innocents locked in prisons, and believers persecuted for preaching the word of God.  You watched the Women in White bruised, bloodied, and captured on their way from Mass.  You have heard the chilling cries of loved ones, or the cracks of firing squads piercing through the ocean breeze.  Not a good sound.Among the courageous Cuban dissidents with us onstage here today are Cary Roque, who was imprisoned by the Castro regime 15 years ago.  (Applause.)  She looks awfully good.   MS. ROQUE:  Thank you, Mr. President.  Thank you, Mr. Vice President.  Thank you, Marco Rubio, Mario Diaz-Balart.  Thank you to all the men and the Cubans who fight no matter what -- for the Cuban liberty.  Mr. President, on behalf of the Cuban people, the people inside my eyes, my homeland, thank you.  Thank you, and we appreciate your love.  (Applause.)THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  Wow.  That's pretty good.  She didn't know she was going to do that either, I will tell you.  Thank you very much.Antunez, imprisoned for 17 years.  Where is he?  (Applause.)  I love that name.  Antunez -- I love that name --and Angel De Fana, imprisoned for over 20 years.  (Applause.)  Thank you.  Thank you.  Very brave people.The exiles and dissidents here today have witnessed communism destroy a nation, just as communism has destroyed every single nation where it has ever been tried.  (Applause.)  But we will not be silent in the face of communist oppression any longer.  You have seen the truth, you have spoken the truth, and the truth has now called us -- this group -- called us to action.  Thank you.Last year, I promised to be a voice against repression in our region -- remember, tremendous oppression -- and a voice for the freedom of the Cuban people.  You heard that pledge.  You exercised the right you have to vote.  You went out and you voted.  And here I am like I promised -- like I promised.  (Applause.)I promised you -- I keep my promises.  Sometimes in politics, they take a little bit longer, but we get there.  We get there.  Don't we get there?  You better believe it, Mike.  We get there.  (Laughter.)  Thank you.  Thank you.  No, we keep our promise.And now that I am your President, America will expose the crimes of the Castro regime and stand with the Cuban people in their struggle for freedom.  Because we know it is best for America to have freedom in our hemisphere, whether in Cuba or Venezuela, and to have a future where the people of each country can live out their own dreams.  (Applause.)For nearly six decades, the Cuban people have suffered under communist domination.  To this day, Cuba is ruled by the same people who killed tens of thousands of their own citizens, who sought to spread their repressive and failed ideology throughout our hemisphere, and who once tried to host enemy nuclear weapons 90 miles from our shores.The Castro regime has shipped arms to North Korea and fueled chaos in Venezuela.  While imprisoning innocents, it has harbored cop killers, hijackers, and terrorists.  It has supported human trafficking, forced labor, and exploitation all around the globe.  This is the simple truth of the Castro regime. (Applause.)My administration will not hide from it, excuse it, or glamorize it.  And we will never, ever be blind to it.  We know what's going on and we remember what happened.  (Applause.)On my recent trip overseas, I said the United States is adopting a principled realism, rooted in our values, shared interests, and common sense.  I also said countries should take greater responsibility for creating stability in their own regions.  It's hard to think of a policy that makes less sense than the prior administration’s terrible and misguided deal with the Castro regime.  (Applause.)  Well, you have to say, the Iran deal was pretty bad also.  Let's not forget that beauty.They made a deal with a government that spreads violence and instability in the region and nothing they got -- think of it -- nothing they got -- they fought for everything and we just didn’t fight hard enough.  But now those days are over.  Now we hold the cards.  We now hold the cards.  (Applause.) The previous administration’s easing of restrictions on travel and trade does not help the Cuban people -- they only enrich the Cuban regime.  (Applause.)  The profits from investment and tourism flow directly to the military.  The regime takes the money and owns the industry.  The outcome of the last administration’s executive action has been only more repression and a move to crush the peaceful, democratic movement.Therefore, effective immediately, I am canceling the last administration’s completely one-sided deal with Cuba.  (Applause.) AUDIENCE:  Trump!  Trump!  Trump!THE PRESIDENT:  I am announcing today a new policy, just as I promised during the campaign, and I will be signing that contract right at that table in just a moment.  (Applause.) Our policy will seek a much better deal for the Cuban people and for the United States of America.  We do not want U.S. dollars to prop up a military monopoly that exploits and abuses the citizens of Cuba.Our new policy begins with strictly enforcing U.S. law.  (Applause.)  We will not lift sanctions on the Cuban regime until all political prisoners are freed, freedoms of assembly and expression are respected, all political parties are legalized, and free and internationally supervised elections are scheduled.  Elections.  (Applause.) We will very strongly restrict American dollars flowing to the military, security and intelligence services that are the core of Castro regime.  They will be restricted.  We will enforce the ban on tourism.  We will enforce the embargo.  We will take concrete steps to ensure that investments flow directly to the people, so they can open private businesses and begin to build their country’s great, great future -- a country of great potential.  (Applause.) My action today bypasses the military and the government, to help the Cuban people themselves form businesses and pursue much better lives.  We will keep in place the safeguards to prevent Cubans from risking their lives to unlawful travel to the United States.  They are in such danger the way they have to come to this country, and we are going to be safeguarding those people.  We have to.  We have no choice.  We have to.  (Applause.) And we will work for the day when a new generation of leaders brings this long reign of suffering to an end.  And I do believe that end is in the very near future.  (Applause.) We challenge Cuba to come to the table with a new agreement that is in the best interests of both their people and our people and also of Cuban Americans.To the Cuban government, I say:  Put an end to the abuse of dissidents.  Release the political prisoners.  Stop jailing innocent people.  Open yourselves to political and economic freedoms.  Return the fugitives from American justice -- including the return of the cop-killer Joanne Chesimard.  (Applause.) And finally, hand over the Cuban military criminals who shot down and killed four brave members of Brothers to the Rescue who were in unarmed, small, slow civilian planes.  (Applause.)  Those victims included Mario de la Pena, Jr., and Carlos Costa.  We are honored to be joined by Mario’s parents, Miriam and Mario, and Carlos’s sister, Mirta.  Where are you?  (Applause.)  Those are great, great parents who love their children so much.  What they've done is just an incredible, incredible thing -- what they represent -- they did not die in vain -- what they represent to everybody, and especially to the Cuban people.  So your children did not die in vain, believe me.  (Applause.) So to the Castro regime, I repeat:  The harboring of criminals and fugitives will end.  You have no choice.  It will end.  (Applause.) Any changes to the relationship between the United States and Cuba will depend on real progress toward these and the other goals, many of which I’ve described.  When Cuba is ready to take concrete steps to these ends, we will be ready, willing, and able to come to the table to negotiate that much better deal for Cubans, for Americans.  Much better deal and a deal that's fair.  A deal that's fair and a deal that makes sense.  Our embassy remains open in the hope that our countries can forge a much stronger and better path.  America believes that free, independent, and sovereign nations are the best vehicle for human happiness, for health, for education, for safety, for everything.  We all accept that all nations have the right to chart their own paths -- and I’m certainly a very big believer in that -- so we will respect Cuban sovereignty.  But we will never turn our backs on the Cuban people.  That will not happen.  (Applause.) Over the years, a special sympathy has grown between this land of the free, and the beautiful people of that island, so close to our shores and so deeply woven into the history of our region.  America has rejected the Cuban people’s oppressors.  They are rejected.  Officially today, they are rejected.  (Applause.)  And to those people, America has become a source of strength, and our flag a symbol of hope. I know that is exactly what America is to you and what it represents to you.  It represents the same to me.  It represents the same to all of us.  And that is what it was to a little boy, Luis Haza.  You ever hear of Luis?  He became very famous, great talent -- just eight years old when Fidel Castro seized power. At the time, Luis’s father was the police chief in Santiago de Cuba.  You know Santiago?  Yeah?  Oh, they know Santiago.  Just days after Fidel took control, his father was one of 71 Cubans executed by firing squad near San Juan Hill at the hands of the Castro regime. Luis buried his grief in his great love of music.  He began playing the violin so brilliantly and so beautifully.  Soon the regime saw his incredible gift and wanted to use him for propaganda purposes.  When he was 12, they organized a national television special and demanded he play a solo for Raul Castro  -- who by the way is leaving now.  I wonder why.They sent an official to fetch Luis from his home.  But Luis refused to go.  And a few days later, Castro’s soldiers barged into his orchestra practice area, guns blazing.  They told him to play for them.  Terrified, Luis began to play.  And the entire room was stunned by what they heard.  Ringing out from the trembling boy’s violin was a tune they all recognized.  This young Cuban boy was playing “The Star Spangled Banner.”  (Applause.)  Luis played the American National Anthem all the way through, and when he finished, the room was dead silent. When we say that America stands as a symbol to the world -- a symbol of freedom, and a symbol of hope -- that is what Luis meant, and that is what Luis displayed that day.  It was a big day.  It was a great day.  And that is what we will all remain. That was a very important moment, just like this is now, for Cuba.  A very important moment.  (Applause.)  America will always stand for liberty, and America will always pray and cheer for the freedom of the Cuban people.Now, that little boy, whose story I just told you, the one who played that violin so beautifully so many years ago, is here with us today in our very, very packed and extremely warm auditorium.  (Laughter.)  Of course, he is no longer a little boy, but a world-renowned violinist and conductor -- one of the greats.  And today he will once again play his violin and fill the hearts of all who love and cherish Cuba, the United States, and freedom.  (Applause.)I would like to now invite Luis to the stage.  Luis.  (Applause.)(Luis Haza plays The Star-Spangled Banner on the violin.)AUDIENCE:  USA! USA! USA!  (Applause.)THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Luis.  I just said, so where were you more nervous?  Today or then?  He said, honestly, I think today.  That's pretty -- (laughter.)  Thank you, Luis, that was beautiful.So I want to thank Miami.  I want to thank Little Havana.  Havana, we love.  Do we love it?  Would you move anywhere else?  You wouldn't move to Palm Beach, would you?  No.  No way.  Little Havana.And I want to thank all of our great friends here today.  You've been amazing, loyal, beautiful people.  And thank you.  Don't remind me.  Actually, I was telling Mike, so it was two days -- on my birthday -- until a big day, which turned out to be tomorrow -- the 16th.  That was the day I came down with Melania on the escalator at Trump Tower.  That's tomorrow.  (Applause.)  So it's exactly tomorrow -- two years since we announced.  And it worked out okay.  Worked out okay.  (Applause.)  It's a great honor.  Believe me, it's a great honor.  Right?AUDIENCE:  (Sings Happy Birthday.)THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  Thank you very much.I just want to end by saying may God bless everyone searching for freedom.  May God bless Cuba.  May God bless the United States of America.  And God bless you all.  Thank you.  Now I'm going to sign.  Thank you.(The President participates in a signing.)So this says, ""strengthening the policy of the United States toward Cuba.""  And I can add, ""strengthening a lot.""  (Laughter.)  So this is very important, and you watch what's going to happen.  Going to be a great day for Cuba.  Thank yo"
2017-06-14;https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/06/14/statement-president-trump-shooting-virginia;Statement by President Trump on the Shooting in Virginia;As you all know, shortly after 7:00 a.m. this morning, a gunman opened fire on members of Congress and their staffs as they were practicing for tomorrow's annual charity baseball game.  Authorities are continuing to investigate the crime, and the assailant has now died from his injuries.  The FBI is leading the investigation and will continue to provide updates as new information becomes available.  Congressman Steve Scalise, a member of House leadership, was shot and badly wounded, and is now in stable condition at the hospital, along with two very courageous Capitol Police officers.  At least two others were also wounded.  Many lives would have been lost if not for the heroic actions of the two Capitol Police officers who took down the gunman despite sustaining gunshot wounds during a very, very brutal assault.  Melania and I are grateful for their heroism and praying for the swift recovery of all victims.  Congressman Scalise is a friend, and a very good friend.  He's a patriot and he's a fighter.  He will recover from this assault.  And, Steve, I want you to know that you have the prayers not only of the entire city behind you, but of an entire nation and, frankly, the entire world.  America is praying for you and America is praying for all of the victims of this terrible shooting.I spoke with Steve's wife, Jennifer, and I pledged to her our full and absolute support -- anything she needs.  We are with her and with the entire Scalise family.I have also spoken with Chief Matthew Verderosa -- he's doing a fantastic job -- of the Capitol Police to express our sympathies for his wounded officers and to express my admiration for their courage.  Our brave Capitol Police perform a challenging job with incredible skill, and their sacrifice makes democracy possible.We also commend the brave first responders from Alexandria Police, Fire and Rescue who rushed to the scene.  Everyone on that field is a public servant -- our courageous police, our congressional aides who work so tirelessly behind the scenes with enormous devotion, and our dedicated members of Congress who represent our people.We may have our differences, but we do well, in times like these, to remember that everyone who serves in our nation’s capital is here because, above all, they love our country.We can all agree that we are blessed to be Americans, that our children deserve to grow up in a nation of safety and peace, and that we are strongest when we are unified and when we work together for the common good.Please take a moment today to cherish those you love, and always remember those who serve and keep us safe.  God bless them all
2017-06-13;https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/06/13/remarks-president-trump-healthcare;Remarks by President Trump on Healthcare;Thank you.  Thank you, everybody.  Thank you very much.  Millions of American families -- and I mean millions -- continue to suffer from Obamacare while congressional Democrats obstruct our efforts to rescue them.  And I'll tell you, that's exactly what’s happening.  The Democrats have let you down, big league.  Standing beside me are two such families, representing so many others -- millions of people -- who have been victimized by Obamacare -- terrible law. My thanks to Michael and Tammy Kushman from Marinette County, and Robert and Sarah Stoll from Kenosha, as well as their wonderful families, for joining us today.  We appreciate it.  We appreciate all the people being here.  Thank you, folks.  (Applause.)  They love their country, play by the rules, and work hard to give their loved ones the best life possible.Michael Kushman is a proud veteran of the United States Army Medical Service Core.  He and his wife Tammy were forced onto the Obamacare exchange in 2015 -- and like countless others, they were shocked to learn that they couldn’t keep their doctor as promised.   They couldn't keep their plan as promised.  They started out paying $600 per month.  Then their insurer quit the exchange, so they had to switch to a new plan, and it went up to $1,000 a month.  And it keeps going up and up and up.  And that's where we are today.  Now it's over $1,400 per month.  They’ve been forced off their plans and onto a new one three times in three years.  Their premiums have soared 127 percent.  The Kushmans now spend nearly one-fourth of their net monthly income on health insurance.  So -- both of you, both families.  Both great families.  Robert and his wife Sarah Stoll have also endured enormous pain under the crushing burden of Obamacare.  Robert serves as a volunteer captain for the Randall Fire Department.  He was a small business owner for 30 years.  But their Obamacare premiums doubled, and Sarah was forced to leave retirement and find a part-time job just to pay the bills.  When she did so, making matters worse, their new income meant they were no longer eligible for the tax credit they had once received -- and the federal government actually forced them to repay thousands of dollars.These are sad -- I agree, that's true.  Has it happened to you also?  Yes.  Yeah, it has.  These are sad but familiar stories in Wisconsin, where Obamacare premiums have doubled.  Obamacare is one of the greatest catastrophes that our country has signed into law -- and the victims are innocent, hardworking Americans like Michael and Tammy, Robert and Sarah.  These citizens deserve so much better. The House of Representatives has passed on to the Senate, and the Senate is getting ready to do something -- hopefully it will get done -- where we will come up with a solution, and a really good one, to healthcare.  No matter how good it is, we will get no obstructionist Democrat votes.  No matter how good it is -- if it's the greatest healthcare plan ever devised, we will get zero votes by the obstructionists, the Democrats.  It's time to give American families quality, reliable, affordable healthcare -- and that’s what we are working very hard to do.  And we'll get it done.So I want to thank you, I want to thank the families -- thank you very much -- for being here.  And I love being in Wisconsin.  I love being in Wisconsin.  Thank you.
2017-06-13;https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/06/13/remarks-president-trump-lunch-members-congress;Remarks by President Trump Before Lunch with Members of Congress;"Thank you very much.  Greatly appreciate it.  I'm very happy that you're all here today with Republican senators.  We're going to be discussing the urgent need to repeal and replace the disaster known as Obamacare.  It was just announced yesterday that 2 million people have dropped out of Obamacare -- 2 million additional.  They are leaving fast.  Premiums have increased by an average of more than 100 percent nationwide.  In North Carolina, premiums have gone up 176 percent.  In Arkansas, premiums have gone up 128 percent.  In Pennsylvania, premiums have gone up by 120 percent.  And I hate to say this to you, Lisa, but in Alaska, they've gone up 207 percent on Obamacare.  You know, I used to mention only Arizona because they were up 116 percent in Arizona.  Now Arizona is like good by comparison to some of the numbers.  But they're way up in Arizona, also.Insurers are fleeing the market.  Last week it was announced that one of the largest insurers is pulling out of Ohio -- the great state of Ohio.  That could mean another 20 counties.  At least 19,000 people in Ohio will have no plan at all.Nationwide, one in three U.S. counties have only a single insurer, and many of those insurers, as you know, have announced that they're leaving.  Obamacare has been broken, and it's been a broken promise.  One after another, Americans were told that if you liked your doctor, you'll keep your doctor.  That was a lie.  They were told that if you liked your plan, you could keep your plan.  That was a lie.  Americans were told that premiums would go down by $2,500 per year.  And instead, their premiums went up to levels that nobody thought even possible.The House has passed a bill, and now the Senate is working very, very hard, and specifically the folks in this room.  And I really appreciate what you're doing.  We'll come out with a bill that's going to be a phenomenal bill for the people of our country.  Generous, kind, with heart -- that's what I'm saying.  And that may be adding additional money into it.  We're going to come out with a real bill, not Obamacare.  And the results are going to be fantastic, and hopefully it will be announced at the appropriate time, and everybody is going to be happy.But by contrast, Republicans in Congress, as hard as they're working, you have the Democrats on the other side who truly have become obstructionists.  Even their new motto, ""Resist"" -- and I guess it's a pretty accurate motto.  Every time I see it, I say, that's right, that does represent the Democrats.  It's called ""Resist"" and it's very unfortunate.  And I actually said, if we came up with the greatest healthcare plan or tax cut -- because we're coming out with a massive tax cut and tax reform -- but if we came up with the greatest healthcare or tax cut ever in our country's history, we wouldn’t get one Democrat vote.  It's obstruction.So the Republicans are working hard.  We passed and signed 38 pieces of legislation, which nobody likes to talk about.  I think probably seldom has any President and administration done more or had more success so early on, including a record number of resolutions to eliminate job-killing regulations.  And we see it all over the country where jobs are starting that would never have started, ever, under any circumstances.  So I'd like to thank our great Vice President for being here.  I'd like to thank all of the senators who I have so much respect for -- I've gotten to know and love some of them, and know and like others.  (Laughter.)  But I have great relationships with every one of them.  And I tell you what, I do have a lot of respect for the people in this room, I can tell you that, very much.  And I appreciate you being here.Just a little bit on the economy.  Unemployment has fallen to a 16-year low, and manufacturing confidence is at an all-time high.  Just came out with a report -- the highest level of confidence in the history of the reports, which are -- they’ve been taking these statistics for many, many years, Mike, I'll tell you.  And in the history of this report, the confidence level is at the highest point it's ever been.  Companies are moving back into the United States.  You see it in Michigan where the auto companies are coming back in and they’re expanding their existing plants, and they’re saying, well, maybe we're just going to have to build in the United States, and that’s the way it's going to be.  I was also really thrilled, last week -- and it had a lot to do with even their opening ceremony -- where, in Pennsylvania, they’re opening a brand new coal mine.  That's the first coal mine that's opened in this country in a long time.  It's brand new.  Many of them are being reopened, but this is a brand new mine.  And that hasn’t happened for many, many years.So we're keeping our promise to the American people.  And that's why it's so important for the Senate and the senators that are with us today to come up with a great healthcare plan.  And I really believe they’re going to be able to do it.  We're very close, and I really think they’re going to be able to do it.So the economy is great.  Everything seems to be working really well.  And a very big focus for us over the next short period of time are going to be tax cuts, tax reform.  We're going to be putting in a very major infrastructure plan.  And so this week, in particular, we're going to be focused on Obamacare repeal and replace.  I've been talking about repealing and replacing Obamacare now for almost a year.  Don't forget, on June 16th -- June 14th is my birthday, but June 16th was the day I announced that I was running.  Some people said, ""Really?  Not going to happen.""  And it happened.  But it's been exactly -- so in three days it's exactly three years.  So we're very happy about that.  And from day one, I said we're going to repeal and replace Obamacare.  And that's what we're going to do.So we've kept our promises.  We've gotten rid of the regulations.  The economy is going really well and going to get even a lot better.  Our numbers for the quarter are going to be very good, I believe.  When the numbers are announced, the GDP numbers, I think they’re going to be shockingly good, based on all of the facts that we're hearing and based on the enthusiasm from the businesses, because they’re doing well.  And we've just started.So I want to thank you all, and I want to thank you senators for being here.  We appreciate it.  And now what we'll do is we'll start talking about the replacement for Obamacare, which will be far better than Obamacare.Thank you very much.Q    What’s your timeframe, Mr. President -- your timeline for the replacement bill?THE PRESIDENT:  As soon as we can do it.  As soon as we can do it.  Q    Mr. President, should Bob Mueller be fired?Thank you very much, everybody.  Q    Should Bob Mueller be fired?THE PRESIDEN"
2017-06-12;https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/06/12/remarks-president-trump-welcoming-2016-ncaa-national-football-champion;Remarks by President Trump in Welcoming the 2016 NCAA National Football Champion Clemson Tigers;everybody.  Today, I'm truly proud to welcome to the White House our College Football Playoff National Champions, the Clemson Tigers.  (Applause.)  And they look like the real deal, don't they? Congratulations to all of you, and to your terrific coach -- and you know who that is, right?  Do we love him?  (Applause.)  Dabo!  Dabo Swinney.  What a great job.  I was with Coach Belichick -- he said, this guy is a real coach.  That's a pretty good compliment, right?  You can't do better than that.  Congratulations, Coach.You have many dedicated fans and admirers here today to celebrate your victory, including many distinguished members of Congress -- lots of them.  I especially want to thank your Governor, Henry McMaster -- my friend, my endorser.  Don't forget, he endorsed me when it wasn’t exactly in vogue to do that.  So I remember.  Right, Henry?  And thank you, Henry, and everybody for joining us today. Clemson Tigers, you gave America an incredible game that will go down in the record books as one of the hardest fought and probably one of the most exciting games ever played.  Last second -- boomf.  That's pretty good, Coach.  Good job, Coach.  All of you played with such tremendous heart and determination.  You never, ever gave up.  You can never give up in life.  And it all paid off.  With your grit and resolve, you proved one of the most important truths in life -- that success is about how hard you are willing to fight in order to overcome and in order to win.After being down 14 to nothing -- I don't think the Coach was worried.  Were you worried?  Yes, probably a little bit.  How about a little bit, Coach?  Maybe?  You're down 14 to nothing almost halfway through the game, like true tigers, Clemson roared back -- and with the whole nation watching, and beyond the nation, Deshaun Watson -- going to be a great NFL player, watch. (Applause.)  Where’s Deshaun?  Get over here.  Come here.  (Applause.)  Hey, fellas, is he that good?  Tell me.  (Applause.) You better believe it.  He’s going to be fantastic.  He passed the ball to Hunter Renfrow -- (applause) -- where’s Hunter?  (Applause.)  Oh, Hunter, you're so lucky you caught that ball.  (Laughter.)  To score the game-winning touchdown with just one second left on the clock.  That's pretty cool.  It was an inspirational finish to a historic season for Clemson.  The team willed their victory -- you willed it.  That was a victory that was willed.  Arnold Palmer -- they used to say great champion -- he would will a victory.  Jack Nicklaus, he would will a victory.  The great champions tend to do that.  This team willed their whole way to victory.  You came so incredibly close last year against Alabama -- you don't remember that game, Coach, do you?  (Laughter.)  You’ll never forget.  And you wanted a rematch, and you got the rematch, and you went on and you earned it.  You beat great teams like Florida State, Ohio State, and, of course, your big rival, South Carolina.  (Applause.)You believed in yourselves, you believed in each other, and you won a championship victory for the ages.  It's one of the greatest games I ever watched, actually. People are going to be talking about what you did for a very, very long time.  That victory and the great comeback was the product of a vision that began nine years ago, when Coach Swinney assembled a team of assistant coaches who believed in his vision.  They recruited great, great players, and together, you worked hard, had fun, and turned Clemson football into a winning machine.  It's what it is.The Tigers have gone an astonishing 89 and 28 -- how did you lose 28 games, Coach?  (Laughter.)  That was the early seasons, right?  Most of them were in the -- while you were building -- under the Coach’s leadership.  He helped forge a new culture at Clemson.  It was on display in the locker room right after the big game.  The Coach recalled how he told the team that “the theme of the college football playoffs this year is ‘chasing greatness.’” He told them, “Nobody is better than us, and we’ve got to believe it!”  It's great.  Tell yourself that -- nobody is better.  You chased greatness, and now you’ve achieved true greatness.I understand that on the inside of your championship ring, there’s a tiger climbing upwards, and it says “little extra” -- just a little extra.  That’s often the difference between winning and losing, just a “little extra.”  Right, Coach?  Is that right? And by the way, standing next to the Coach is another winner -- your El Presidente -- Jim Clements.  That's another winner, I'll tell you that.  (Applause.)We don't talk about Jim too much.  But number one, he made a lot of good decisions.  Number two, what people don't realize about Clemson -- it's a great academic school.  One of the top 25.  And as a combination -- probably number one, right?  Great job, Jim.  (Applause.)  That’s how Clemson achieved great things.  When you set an expectation of maximum effort and a culture of confidence from the top, you inspire every person to perform at their very, very best.And that is exactly what you have done.  More Tigers this year than ever before -- nine of you -- went to the NFL Scouting Combine, and two of you were drafted in the first round.  That's pretty good.But during that championship game, all of you shined --_every single one.  Offensive MVP, Quarterback Deshaun Watson took some very, very hard hits but he never rattled.  He's great under pressure.  I've seen that.  I've heard that.  He's great under pressure.  That's a good thing to be.  He is great under pressure.  He always got right back up.  And he fought, and he fought, and he kept winning.  Now he’ll bring that toughness together to the Houston Texans.  And I have the owners of the Texans here someplace-- we just saw them -- and they are so excited about Deshaun.  Defensive Tackle Carlos Watkins had an incredible game, and he’ll be joining Deshaun in Houston.  I'm going to be watching that team very closely. Nobody can read plays like Defensive MVP Ben Boulware. Where's Ben?  (Applause.)  Carlos -- get up here, Carlos.  (Applause.)  You think I could take these guys in a fight?  I don't know.  (Applause.)  Great guys.First Team All-American Defensive End Christian Wilkins was a big part of the defensive effort in the championship game.  And Wide Receiver Hunter Renfrow had that incredible 10 receptions that night.I also want to extend our best wishes to Defensive End Richard Yeargin, who suffered a terrible neck injury in a recent automobile accident and is out for the 2017 season.  But he'll be back.  And we’re praying for you.  And, Richard, I know you're going to get better and you're going to be all set.All of you are continuing a proud sporting tradition at Clemson, established long ago by some of football’s greatest champions and leaders.  Your school was home to the legendary Coach Heisman -- Heisman Trophy -- who delivered a win in the Tigers’ first Alabama matchup way back in 1900.  I know Coach Heisman would be very proud of you, Coach, today, looking down -- would be very proud -- he liked to win, he knew winners -- and his team’s most recent, incredible, and most exciting victory.  So thank you for being here today.  It's our honor to be in the company of great, great champions.  And that's what they are. I wish you all the best in your careers, wherever they may take you.  Whether it's football or business or anything else, you're going to be very successful.  And if you work hard, fight hard, and believe in yourselves, perhaps I’ll see you one day back here right at the White House.  In fact, I think one of the folks behind me has a really good chance of standing where I am today as a future President of the United States.  They have that tremendous, incredible talent -- more than just athletic talent.So congratulations, again, to the College Football Playoff National Champions, the Clemson Tigers!  And with that, I want to introduce President Jim Clements, who has truly done an amazing job on and off the field.  And he’s a special man -- that I can tell 
2017-06-09;https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/06/09/remarks-president-trump-regulatory-relief;Remarks by President Trump on Regulatory Relief;"Thank you, Secretary Chao.  Thank you, everybody.  This is very nice, by the way.  Beautiful.  I want to really thank you.  You have been so amazing as the leader of this department, and the progress is being made so quickly.  Leaders and officials gathered here from across the country have all praised the work that the Secretary is doing to create a safe, modern and reliable transportation system for the United States and for its great, great, great people.I also want to thank Secretary Zinke for the fantastic job he’s doing at the Department of the Interior to clear the way for new infrastructure and economic development. Both Secretary Chao and Zinke joined us at the White House yesterday for a meeting with state and local leaders to develop plans to replace America’s decaying infrastructure and construct new roads, rails, pipelines, tunnels, and bridges all across our nation. We are here today to focus on solving one of the biggest obstacles to creating this new and desperately needed infrastructure, and that is the painfully slow, costly, and time-consuming process of getting permits and approvals to build.  And I also knew that from the private sector.  It is a long, slow, unnecessarily burdensome process.My administration is committed to ending these terrible delays once and for all.  The excruciating wait time for permitting has inflicted enormous financial pain to cities and states all throughout our nation and has blocked many important projects from ever getting off the ground.  Many, many projects are long gone because they couldn’t get permits and there was no reason for it.We’ve already taken historic steps to speed up the approvals, including the approval of the Keystone XL Pipeline -- which was very quickly approved.  They were sitting there for a long time saying, well, that project is dead.  Then I came into office and, all of the sudden, a miracle.  And I guarantee you, the consultants went over to the heads of the company and told them what a great job they did.  They asked for a lot of money, most likely.  But we got it approved.  And we got it approved fast. I’m also very proud to say that the Dakota Access Pipeline is now officially open for business.  It was dead 120 days ago, and now it officially just opened for business. Very proud of that.  Hi, Bill.We’re also excited to be joined by representatives from our labor unions, including the North America Building Trades Union, which I know well, and the Laborers International Union of North America.  You will play a -- go ahead, fellas, take a little credit.  Come on, fellas. You will play a central role in rebuilding America.  Very important.We’re also joined, as well, by many distinguished members of Congress who share our total passion and desire to repair and restore America’s highways, railways, and waterways.  In the audience is Chairman Bill Shuster of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee.  Stand up, Bill. Thank you, Bill, great job -- who is working very closely with us, including on our proposal to dramatically reduce airport delays by reforming air traffic control. We have an obsolete system.  And I have to say, before Elaine got here, they had spent close to $7 billion on the system.  Boom -- a waste.  All wasted.  But we’re going to have a great system -- great new system.  A top of the line -- it will be the best in the world.  Right now, we’re at the lowest part of the pack.  It will be the best in the world, for a lot less money than they’ve been wasting for years.For too long, America has poured trillions and trillions of dollars into rebuilding foreign countries while allowing our own country -- the country that we love -- and its infrastructure to fall into a state of total disrepair.  We have structurally deficient bridges, clogged roads, crumbling dams and locks.  Our rivers are in trouble.  Our railways are aging.  And chronic traffic that slows commerce and diminishes our citizens' quality of life.  Other than that, we’re doing very well.Instead of rebuilding our country, Washington has spent decades building a dense thicket of rules, regulations and red tape.  It took only four years to build the Golden Gate Bridge and five years to build the Hoover Dam and less than one year to build the Empire State Building.  People don’t believe that.  It took less than one year.  But today, it can take 10 years and far more than that just to get the approvals and permits needed to build a major infrastructure project. These charts beside me are actually a simplified version of our highway permitting process.  It includes 16 different approvals involving 10 different federal agencies being governed by 26 different statutes. As one example -- and this happened just 30 minutes ago -- I was sitting with a great group of people responsible for their state’s economic development and roadways.  All of you are in the room now.  And one gentleman from Maryland was talking about an 18-mile road.  And he brought with him some of the approvals that they’ve gotten and paid for.  They spent $29 million for an environmental report, weighing 70 pounds and costing $24,000 per page.And I said, do me a favor.  I’m going to make a speech in a little while.  Do you mind if I take that and show it?  So I’m going to show it.  So they spent millions and millions of dollars.  When I said, how long has this short roadway been talked about, the gentleman said, well, if you say 20 years, you’re safe.  I said, yeah, don’t say anymore because I have to be -- you know, I have to be exactly accurate with these people.  I was off by like two months -- it’s a major front-page story.But these binders on the stage could be replaced by just a few simple pages, and it would be just as good.  It was actually be much better.  Because these binders also make you do unnecessary things that cost billions and billions of dollars and they actually make it worse.As another example, the 23 -- if you look at it, in Ohio, the Ohio River Bridge -- $2.3 billion.  The project amassed a 150,000-page administrative record -- 150,000 pages is a five-story-tall building.  Think of it.  If you put the paper together, it’s a five-story building.How can a country prosper under this kind of nonsense?  And I know it.  I know it so well, being in the private sector.  But you know, in the private sector you move, and you wheel, and you deal, and you hope, and you pray.  And maybe it goes a little faster, but it’s a horrible thing in the private sector also.  And we’re talking about reducing that for the private sector likewise.Why should we continue to accept what is so clearly unacceptable?  Oftentimes, the consultants -- that are making a fortune because you can’t doing anything without hiring them, paying them a tremendous amount of money, having them write up this nonsense -- you can’t get approvals.  And they’re in, in the case of New York, Albany -- they go to Albany, the state capital or, here, they go to Washington for federal.  And they want to make it really tough because that way, you have to hire them.  It's a terrible thing.  It's a group of people -- probably nobody has ever heard anybody talk about it because -- I know it because I'm a business guy, I understand that.  They work really hard to make it difficult.  And some are believers, but most aren't.  Most want to make a lot of money.  So they make a very, very simple roadway or whatever you want to be building a very complicated subject, and they make it very much more expensive and they make it worse.  It's not as good as it would have been.I was not elected to continue a failed system.  I was elected to change it.  All of us in government service were elected to solve the problems that have plagued our nation.  We are here to think big, to act boldly, and to rise above the petty partisan squabbling of Washington D.C.  We are here to take action.  It’s time to start building in our country, with American workers and with American iron, and aluminum and steel. It’s time to put up soaring new infrastructure that inspires pride in our people and our towns.When I approved the Keystone Pipeline I said, where was the pipe made?  Unfortunately, they had purchased a lot of it, but I put a little clause at the bottom -- you want to build a pipeline in this country, buy American steel and let it be fabricated here. Very simple little clause written in hand, but it does the trick.It is time, at last, to put America First.  Americans deserve the best infrastructure anywhere in the world.  They deserve roads and bridges that are safe to travel, and pipes that deliver clean water into their homes.  Not like what happened in Flint, Michigan.  They deserve lanes of commerce that get people and products where they need to go on time.  Most of all, Americans deserve a system of infrastructure that is looked upon not with pity -- the world, in many cases, is so far advanced that they look at our infrastructure as being sad.  We want them to look at us with envy -- a system worthy of our magnificent country.No longer can we allow these rules and regulations to tie down our economy, chain up our prosperity, and sap our great American spirit.  That is why we will lift these restrictions and unleash the full potential of the United States of America.To all our state and local leaders, I appreciate you being here today.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you, Bill.  I want you to know that help is finally -- after many, many decades -- on its way.  We are giving control back to the cities and the states.  You know best how to plan your communities, analyze your projects, and protect your local environment.We will get rid of the redundancy and duplication that wastes your time and your money.  Our goal is to give you one point of contact to deliver one decision -- yes or no -- for the entire federal government, and to deliver that decision quickly, whether it's a road, whether it's a highway, a bridge, a dam.To do this, we are setting up a new council to help project managers navigate the bureaucratic maze.  This council will also improve transparency by creating a new online dashboard allowing everyone to easily track major projects through every stage of the approval process.  This council will make sure that every federal agency that is consistently delaying projects by missing deadlines will face tough, new penalties.  I know it won't happen with these two.  We don't have to worry about them.  We will hold the bureaucracy accountable. We are also creating a new office in the Council of Environmental Quality to root out inefficiency, clarify lines of authority, and streamline federal and state and local procedures so that communities can modernize their aging infrastructure without fear of outdated federal rules getting in their way. This massive permit reform -- and that's what it is; it's a permit reform -- doesn’t sound glamorous.  They won't write stories about it.  They won't even talk about it.  But it's so important.  But it's only the first step in renewing America’s roads, rails, runways and rivers. As I discussed in Ohio recently, my new vision for American infrastructure will generate $1 trillion in infrastructure investment -- which we desperately need.  We've spent, as of a few months ago, $6 trillion in the Middle East.  Think of it -- $6 trillion in the Middle East.  And it's worse than it was 15 years ago by a factor of 10.  And yet, if you want to build a little road in one of your communities in Pennsylvania or Ohio, or in Iowa, or in North Carolina, or in Florida, you can't get the money.State and local leaders will have more power to decide which projects get built, when they start and how they are funded.  And investors will have a much more predictable environment that encourages them to invest billions of dollars in capital that is currently stuck on the sidelines.Together, we will build projects to inspire our youth, employ our workers, and create true prosperity for our people.  We will pour new concrete, lay new brick, and watch new sparks light our factories as we forge metal from the furnaces of our Rust Belt and our beloved heartland -- which has been forgotten. It's not forgotten anymore. We will put new American steel into the spine of our country.  American workers will construct gleaming new lanes of commerce across our landscape.  They will build these monuments from coast to coast, and from city to city.  And with these new roads, bridges, airports and seaports, we will embark on a wonderful new journey into a bright and glorious future.  We will build again.  We will grow again.  We will thrive again.  And we will Make America Great Again.Thank you.  God bless"
2017-06-05;https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/06/05/remarks-president-trump-announcement-air-traffic-control-initiative;Remarks by President Trump at Announcement of Air Traffic Control Initiative;Thank you very much.  Thank you, Mike.  I really appreciate everything and I appreciate you being here.  But I especially want to thank Secretary Elaine Chao, Leader Kevin McCarthy -- thank you, Kevin -- Chairman Bill Shuster -- thank you very much, Bill -- and all the members of Congress -- we have many of them here today -- for joining us as we prepare to enter a great new era in American aviation.  (Applause.)  It’s about time, too, I can tell you.But before discussing our plans to modernize air travel, I want to provide an update on our efforts to fix and modernize vital services for our veterans -- our great, great veterans who we all love.  For decades the federal government has struggled to accomplish something that should be very, very simple -- seamlessly transferring a veteran’s medical records from the Defense Department to the veterans groups and to the VA.  In recent years, it has taken not just days or weeks, but many months for the records to follow the veteran.  This has caused massive problems for our veterans.  I’m very proud to say that we are finally taking steps to solve this situation once and for all.  Secretary Shulkin announced this morning that the VA will announce and modernize its medical records to use the same system as the Department of Defense.  No more complications.  The records will now be able to follow the veteran when they leave service -- meaning faster, better, and far better quality care.  (Applause.)  Thank you.This is one of the biggest wins for our veterans in decades.  And I congratulate Secretary Shulkin for making this very, very important decision.  Thank you, Secretary.  Appreciate it.  I appreciate it.  He’s done a great job.  Stand up, Secretary.  Where is Secretary Shulkin?  What a great job.  Thank you.Of course, there is still much work to do, but today’s action shows the determined leadership and what it can accomplish -- great, great reform.  So, again, to David Shulkin, thank you.  To all of our veterans who have a served this nation, a very, very special thank you.  This is truly wonderful, really monumental reform, so important for our veterans.  But it’s just the beginning.We’re here today to discuss another issue that has gone unsolved for far too long.  For too many years, our country has tolerated unacceptable delays at the airport, long wait times on the tarmac, and a slowing of commerce and travel that costs us billions and billions of dollars in lost hours and lost dollars themselves.  Today, we are proposing to take American air travel into the future -- finally.  (Applause.)  Finally, right?  Finally.  It’s been a long time.We’re proposing reduced wait times, increased route efficiency, and far fewer delays.  Our plan will get you where you need to go more quickly, more reliably, more affordably and, yes -- for the first time in a long time -- on time.  We will launch this air travel revolution by modernizing the outdated system of air traffic control.  It’s about time.  (Applause.) Since the early days of commercial air service, the federal government has owned and operated the United States air traffic control system.  Yet, more than a half a century later, the government is still using much of the exact same outdated technology.  At a time when every passenger has GPS technology in their pockets, our air traffic control system still runs on radar and ground-based radio systems that they don’t even make anymore, they can’t even fix anymore, and many controllers must use slips of paper to track our thousands and thousands of planes that are up in the air.Our air traffic control system was designed when roughly 100,000 people flew at our airports each year.  We are now approaching nearly one billion passengers annually.  The current system cannot keep up -- hasn’t been able to keep up for many years.  It causes flight delays and crippling inefficiencies, costing our economy as much as $25 billion a year in economic output.  We live in a modern age, yet our air traffic control system is stuck painfully in the past.The FAA has been trying to upgrade our nation’s air traffic control system for a long period of years.  But after billions and billions of tax dollars spent and the many years of delays, we are still stuck with an ancient, broken, antiquated, horrible system that doesn’t work.  Other than that, it’s quite good.  (Laughter.) The previous administration spent over $7 billion trying to upgrade the system, and totally failed.  Honestly, they didn’t know what the hell they were doing.  A total waste of money -- $7 billion-plus-plus. It’s time to join the future.  That is why I’m proposing new principles to Congress for air traffic control reform making flights quicker, safer and more reliable.  Crucially, these reforms are supported by air traffic controllers themselves.  They’re the ones that know the systems that they want.  They know it better than anybody.  And we have people -- they don’t even call them in the past.  But now we call them.I’m also proud to be joined today by passenger advocates, pilot unions, and leaders of airlines and cargo companies who strongly support our new framework and our bidding process.  And we’re bidding, ideally, to one great company -- there will be many bids, but one great company that can piece it all together -- not many companies all over the United States, like in the past.  When they came time to piece it together, it didn’t work.  There were all different systems.  We threw away billions and billions of dollars.I am very grateful that every former FAA chief and chief operating officers and three former Transportation Secretaries -- Jim Burnley, Elizabeth Dole, and Mary Peters -- stand with us today.  Thank you.  (Applause.)  This is an incredible coalition for change.  All over the room, it’s a coalition for change.  The leaders of the industry.  At its core, our new plan will dramatically improve America’s air traffic control system by turning it over to a self-financing, non-profit organization.  This new entity will not need taxpayer money, which is very shocking when people hear that.  They don’t hear that too often.Under this new plan, the Federal Aviation Administration will focus firmly on what it does best -- safety.  A separate non-profit entity would be charged with ensuring route efficiency, timely service, and a long-awaited reduction in delays.Our plan will also maintain support for rural communities and small airports, including airfields used by our Air National Guard units -- great people.  And, very importantly, air traffic controllers will highly -- and this will be highly valued.  These are highly valued people.  These are amazing people that know this system so well.  And under our plan, they will have more financial security, professional opportunity, and far superior equipment.  The best equipment anywhere in the world.  There will never be anything like what we’re doing.  And other systems are very good.  I won’t tell you the names of the country, but we have studied numerous countries, one in particular -- they have a very, very good system.  Ours is going to top it by a lot. Our incredible air traffic controllers keep us safe every day even though they are forced to use this badly outdated system.  That is why we want to give them access to capital markets and investors so they can obtain the best, newest, and safest technology available.  And by the way, the new technology -- and I’ve seen it -- is incredible.If we adopt these changes, Americans can look forward to cheaper, faster, and safer travel -- a future where 20 percent of a ticket price doesn’t go to the government, and where you don’t have to sit on a tarmac or circle for hours and hours over an airport -- which is very dangerous also -- before you land.Dozens of countries have already made similar changes with terrific results.  And we’re going to top them, actually, by a long shot.  Canada, as an example, modernized their air traffic control through a non-government organization about 20 years ago, and they have cut costs significantly, adopted cutting-edgetechnology, and handled 50 percent more traffic -- and actually, far more than that on a relative basis compared to us.  A modern air traffic control system will make life better for all Americans who travel, ship, or fly.  It will reduce cost and increase convenience for every American consumer -- and these new efficiencies will produce a huge economic boost for the country, and for the 1 in 14 American jobs that aviation supports.Today, we are taking the first important step to clearing the runway for more jobs, lower prices, and much, much, much better transportation.  America is the nation that pioneered air travel, and with these reforms, we can once again lead the way far into the future.  Our nation will move faster, fly higher, and soar proudly toward the next great chapter of American aviation.Thank you.  God bless you.  And God bless the United States of America.  Thank you.  Thank you ve

2017-06-01;https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/06/01/statement-president-trump-paris-climate-accord;Statement by President Trump on the Paris Climate Accord;"Thank you very much.  (Applause.)  Thank you.  I would like to begin by addressing the terrorist attack in Manila.  We’re closely monitoring the situation, and I will continue to give updates if anything happens during this period of time.  But it is really very sad as to what’s going on throughout the world with terror.  Our thoughts and our prayers are with all of those affected.Before we discuss the Paris Accord, I’d like to begin with an update on our tremendous -- absolutely tremendous -- economic progress since Election Day on November 8th.  The economy is starting to come back, and very, very rapidly.  We’ve added $3.3 trillion in stock market value to our economy, and more than a million private sector jobs.I have just returned from a trip overseas where we concluded nearly $350 billion of military and economic development for the United States, creating hundreds of thousands of jobs.  It was a very, very successful trip, believe me.  (Applause.)  Thank you.  Thank you.  In my meetings at the G7, we have taken historic steps to demand fair and reciprocal trade that gives Americans a level playing field against other nations.  We’re also working very hard for peace in the Middle East, and perhaps even peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians.  Our attacks on terrorism are greatly stepped up -- and you see that, you see it all over -- from the previous administration, including getting many other countries to make major contributions to the fight against terror.  Big, big contributions are being made by countries that weren’t doing so much in the form of contribution.One by one, we are keeping the promises I made to the American people during my campaign for President –- whether it’s cutting job-killing regulations; appointing and confirming a tremendous Supreme Court justice; putting in place tough new ethics rules; achieving a record reduction in illegal immigration on our southern border; or bringing jobs, plants, and factories back into the United States at numbers which no one until this point thought even possible.  And believe me, we’ve just begun.  The fruits of our labor will be seen very shortly even more so.On these issues and so many more, we’re following through on our commitments.  And I don’t want anything to get in our way.  I am fighting every day for the great people of this country.  Therefore, in order to fulfill my solemn duty to protect America and its citizens, the United States will withdraw from the Paris Climate Accord -- (applause) -- thank you, thank you -- but begin negotiations to reenter either the Paris Accord or a really entirely new transaction on terms that are fair to the United States, its businesses, its workers, its people, its taxpayers.  So we’re getting out.  But we will start to negotiate, and we will see if we can make a deal that’s fair.  And if we can, that’s great.  And if we can’t, that’s fine.  (Applause.)  As President, I can put no other consideration before the wellbeing of American citizens.  The Paris Climate Accord is simply the latest example of Washington entering into an agreement that disadvantages the United States to the exclusive benefit of other countries, leaving American workers -- who I love -- and taxpayers to absorb the cost in terms of lost jobs, lower wages, shuttered factories, and vastly diminished economic production.Thus, as of today, the United States will cease all implementation of the non-binding Paris Accord and the draconian financial and economic burdens the agreement imposes on our country.  This includes ending the implementation of the nationally determined contribution and, very importantly, the Green Climate Fund which is costing the United States a vast fortune.Compliance with the terms of the Paris Accord and the onerous energy restrictions it has placed on the United States could cost America as much as 2.7 million lost jobs by 2025 according to the National Economic Research Associates.  This includes 440,000 fewer manufacturing jobs -- not what we need -- believe me, this is not what we need -- including automobile jobs, and the further decimation of vital American industries on which countless communities rely.  They rely for so much, and we would be giving them so little. According to this same study, by 2040, compliance with the commitments put into place by the previous administration would cut production for the following sectors:  paper down 12 percent; cement down 23 percent; iron and steel down 38 percent; coal -- and I happen to love the coal miners -- down 86 percent; natural gas down 31 percent.  The cost to the economy at this time would be close to $3 trillion in lost GDP and 6.5 million industrial jobs, while households would have $7,000 less income and, in many cases, much worse than that.Not only does this deal subject our citizens to harsh economic restrictions, it fails to live up to our environmental ideals.  As someone who cares deeply about the environment, which I do, I cannot in good conscience support a deal that punishes the United States -- which is what it does -– the world’s leader in environmental protection, while imposing no meaningful obligations on the world’s leading polluters.For example, under the agreement, China will be able to increase these emissions by a staggering number of years -- 13.  They can do whatever they want for 13 years.  Not us.  India makes its participation contingent on receiving billions and billions and billions of dollars in foreign aid from developed countries.  There are many other examples.  But the bottom line is that the Paris Accord is very unfair, at the highest level, to the United States.Further, while the current agreement effectively blocks the development of clean coal in America -- which it does, and the mines are starting to open up.  We’re having a big opening in two weeks.  Pennsylvania, Ohio, West Virginia, so many places.  A big opening of a brand-new mine.  It’s unheard of.  For many, many years, that hasn’t happened.  They asked me if I’d go.  I’m going to try.China will be allowed to build hundreds of additional coal plants.  So we can’t build the plants, but they can, according to this agreement.  India will be allowed to double its coal production by 2020.  Think of it:  India can double their coal production.  We’re supposed to get rid of ours.  Even Europe is allowed to continue construction of coal plants.  In short, the agreement doesn’t eliminate coal jobs, it just transfers those jobs out of America and the United States, and ships them to foreign countries.This agreement is less about the climate and more about other countries gaining a financial advantage over the United States.  The rest of the world applauded when we signed the Paris Agreement -- they went wild; they were so happy -- for the simple reason that it put our country, the United States of America, which we all love, at a very, very big economic disadvantage.  A cynic would say the obvious reason for economic competitors and their wish to see us remain in the agreement is so that we continue to suffer this self-inflicted major economic wound.  We would find it very hard to compete with other countries from other parts of the world.   We have among the most abundant energy reserves on the planet, sufficient to lift millions of America’s poorest workers out of poverty.  Yet, under this agreement, we are effectively putting these reserves under lock and key, taking away the great wealth of our nation -- it's great wealth, it's phenomenal wealth; not so long ago, we had no idea we had such wealth -- and leaving millions and millions of families trapped in poverty and joblessness.The agreement is a massive redistribution of United States wealth to other countries.  At 1 percent growth, renewable sources of energy can meet some of our domestic demand, but at 3 or 4 percent growth, which I expect, we need all forms of available American energy, or our country -- (applause) -- will be at grave risk of brownouts and blackouts, our businesses will come to a halt in many cases, and the American family will suffer the consequences in the form of lost jobs and a very diminished quality of life.Even if the Paris Agreement were implemented in full, with total compliance from all nations, it is estimated it would only produce a two-tenths of one degree -- think of that; this much -- Celsius reduction in global temperature by the year 2100.  Tiny, tiny amount.  In fact, 14 days of carbon emissions from China alone would wipe out the gains from America -- and this is an incredible statistic -- would totally wipe out the gains from America's expected reductions in the year 2030, after we have had to spend billions and billions of dollars, lost jobs, closed factories, and suffered much higher energy costs for our businesses and for our homes.As the Wall Street Journal wrote this morning:  “The reality is that withdrawing is in America’s economic interest and won’t matter much to the climate.”  The United States, under the Trump administration, will continue to be the cleanest and most environmentally friendly country on Earth.  We'll be the cleanest.  We're going to have the cleanest air.  We're going to have the cleanest water.  We will be environmentally friendly, but we're not going to put our businesses out of work and we're not going to lose our jobs.  We're going to grow; we're going to grow rapidly.  (Applause.)  And I think you just read -- it just came out minutes ago, the small business report -- small businesses as of just now are booming, hiring people.  One of the best reports they've seen in many years.I’m willing to immediately work with Democratic leaders to either negotiate our way back into Paris, under the terms that are fair to the United States and its workers, or to negotiate a new deal that protects our country and its taxpayers.  (Applause.) So if the obstructionists want to get together with me, let’s make them non-obstructionists.  We will all sit down, and we will get back into the deal.  And we’ll make it good, and we won’t be closing up our factories, and we won’t be losing our jobs.  And we’ll sit down with the Democrats and all of the people that represent either the Paris Accord or something that we can do that's much better than the Paris Accord.  And I think the people of our country will be thrilled, and I think then the people of the world will be thrilled.  But until we do that, we're out of the agreement.  I will work to ensure that America remains the world’s leader on environmental issues, but under a framework that is fair and where the burdens and responsibilities are equally shared among the many nations all around the world.  No responsible leader can put the workers -- and the people -- of their country at this debilitating and tremendous disadvantage.  The fact that the Paris deal hamstrings the United States, while empowering some of the world’s top polluting countries, should dispel any doubt as to the real reason why foreign lobbyists wish to keep our magnificent country tied up and bound down by this agreement:  It’s to give their country an economic edge over the United States.  That's not going to happen while I’m President.  I’m sorry.  (Applause.) My job as President is to do everything within my power to give America a level playing field and to create the economic, regulatory and tax structures that make America the most prosperous and productive country on Earth, and with the highest standard of living and the highest standard of environmental protection. Our tax bill is moving along in Congress, and I believe it’s doing very well.  I think a lot of people will be very pleasantly surprised.  The Republicans are working very, very hard.  We’d love to have support from the Democrats, but we may have to go it alone.  But it’s going very well.  The Paris Agreement handicaps the United States economy in order to win praise from the very foreign capitals and global activists that have long sought to gain wealth at our country’s expense.  They don’t put America first.  I do, and I always will.  (Applause.) The same nations asking us to stay in the agreement are the countries that have collectively cost America trillions of dollars through tough trade practices and, in many cases, lax contributions to our critical military alliance.  You see what’s happening.  It’s pretty obvious to those that want to keep an open mind.  At what point does America get demeaned?  At what point do they start laughing at us as a country?   We want fair treatment for its citizens, and we want fair treatment for our taxpayers.  We don’t want other leaders and other countries laughing at us anymore.  And they won’t be.  They won’t be.I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris.  (Applause.)  I promised I would exit or renegotiate any deal which fails to serve America’s interests.  Many trade deals will soon be under renegotiation.  Very rarely do we have a deal that works for this country, but they’ll soon be under renegotiation.  The process has begun from day one.  But now we’re down to business.Beyond the severe energy restrictions inflicted by the Paris Accord, it includes yet another scheme to redistribute wealth out of the United States through the so-called Green Climate Fund -- nice name -- which calls for developed countries to send $100 billion to developing countries all on top of America’s existing and massive foreign aid payments.  So we’re going to be paying billions and billions and billions of dollars, and we’re already way ahead of anybody else.  Many of the other countries haven’t spent anything, and many of them will never pay one dime.  The Green Fund would likely obligate the United States to commit potentially tens of billions of dollars of which the United States has already handed over $1 billion -- nobody else is even close; most of them haven’t even paid anything -- including funds raided out of America’s budget for the war against terrorism.  That’s where they came.  Believe me, they didn’t come from me.  They came just before I came into office.  Not good.  And not good the way they took the money.  In 2015, the United Nation's departing top climate officials reportedly described the $100 billion per year as “peanuts,” and stated that ""the $100 billion is the tail that wags the dog.""  In 2015, the Green Climate Fund’s executive director reportedly stated that estimated funding needed would increase to $450 billion per year after 2020.  And nobody even knows where the money is going to.  Nobody has been able to say, where is it going to? Of course, the world’s top polluters have no affirmative obligations under the Green Fund, which we terminated.  America is $20 trillion in debt.  Cash-strapped cities cannot hire enough police officers or fix vital infrastructure.  Millions of our citizens are out of work.  And yet, under the Paris Accord, billions of dollars that ought to be invested right here in America will be sent to the very countries that have taken our factories and our jobs away from us.  So think of that.  There are serious legal and constitutional issues as well.  Foreign leaders in Europe, Asia, and across the world should not have more to say with respect to the U.S. economy than our own citizens and their elected representatives.  Thus, our withdrawal from the agreement represents a reassertion of America’s sovereignty.  (Applause.)  Our Constitution is unique among all the nations of the world, and it is my highest obligation and greatest honor to protect it.  And I will.Staying in the agreement could also pose serious obstacles for the United States as we begin the process of unlocking the restrictions on America’s abundant energy reserves, which we have started very strongly.  It would once have been unthinkable that an international agreement could prevent the United States from conducting its own domestic economic affairs, but this is the new reality we face if we do not leave the agreement or if we do not negotiate a far better deal.The risks grow as historically these agreements only tend to become more and more ambitious over time.  In other words, the Paris framework is a starting point -- as bad as it is -- not an end point.  And exiting the agreement protects the United States from future intrusions on the United States' sovereignty and massive future legal liability.  Believe me, we have massive legal liability if we stay in.As President, I have one obligation, and that obligation is to the American people.  The Paris Accord would undermine our economy, hamstring our workers, weaken our sovereignty, impose unacceptable legal risks, and put us at a permanent disadvantage to the other countries of the world.  It is time to exit the Paris Accord -- (applause) -- and time to pursue a new deal that protects the environment, our companies, our citizens, and our country.  It is time to put Youngstown, Ohio, Detroit, Michigan, and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania -- along with many, many other locations within our great country -- before Paris, France.  It is time to make America great again.  (Applause.)  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you very much. Thank you very much.  Very important.  I’d like to ask Scott Pruitt, who most of you know and respect, as I do, just to say a few words.  Scott, please.  (Applause.) ADMINISTRATOR PRUITT:  Thank you, Mr. President.  Your decision today to exit the Paris Accord reflects your unflinching commitment to put America first.And by exiting, you're fulfilling yet one more campaign promise to the American people.  Please know that I am thankful for your fortitude, your courage, and your steadfastness as you serve and lead our country.America finally has a leader who answers only to the people -- not to the special interests who have had their way for way too long.  In everything you do, Mr. President, you're fighting for the forgotten men and women across this country.  You're a champion for the hardworking citizens all across this land who just want a government that listens to them and represents their interest.You have promised to put America First in all that you do, and you've done that in any number of ways -- from trade, to national security, to protecting our border, to rightsizing Washington, D.C.  And today you've put America first with regard to international agreements and the environment. This is an historic restoration of American economic independence -- one that will benefit the working class, the working poor, and working people of all stripes.  With this action, you have declared that the people are rulers of this country once again.  And it should be noted that we as a nation do it better than anyone in the world in striking the balance between growing our economy, growing jobs while also being a good steward of our environment.  We owe no apologies to other nations for our environmental stewardship.  After all, before the Paris Accord was ever signed, America had reduced its CO2 footprint to levels from the early 1990s.  In fact, between the years 2000 and 2014, the United States reduced its carbon emissions by 18-plus percent.  And this was accomplished not through government mandate, but accomplished through innovation and technology of the American private sector.For that reason, Mr. President, you have corrected a view that was paramount in Paris that somehow the United States should penalize its own economy, be apologetic, lead with our chin, while the rest of world does little.  Other nations talk a good game; we lead with action -- not words.  (Applause.) Our efforts, Mr. President, as you know, should be on exporting our technology, our innovation to nations who seek to reduce their CO2 footprint to learn from us.  That should be our focus versus agreeing to unachievable targets that harm our economy and the American people.Mr. President, it takes courage, it takes commitment to say no to the plaudits of men while doing what’s right by the American people.  You have that courage, and the American people can take comfort bec"
2017-05-29;https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/05/29/remarks-president-trump-arlington-national-cemetery;Remarks by President Trump at Arlington National Cemetery;Thank you so much.  And thank you, General Dunford and Secretary Mattis, for your moving words and for your service to our great nation.  Vice President Pence, Cabinet Secretaries, members of Congress, members of the Armed Forces and veterans -- thank you for joining us as we honor the brave warriors who gave their lives for ours, spending their last moments on this Earth in defense of this country and of its people.Words cannot measure the depth of their devotion, the purity of their love, or the totality of their courage.  We only hope that every day we can prove worthy not only of their sacrifice and service but of the sacrifice made by the families and loved ones they left behind.  Special, special people.I especially want to extend our gratitude to Secretary John Kelly for joining us today.  Incredible man.  (Applause.)  I always like to call him General.  He understands more than most ever could or ever will the wounds and burdens of war.  Not only did Secretary proudly serve in the military for more than 40 years, enduring many hardships, but he and his incredible wife Karen have borne the single most difficult hardship of them all -- the loss of their son, Robert, in service to our country.  Robert died fighting the enemies of all civilizations in Afghanistan.To John, Karen, Heather, Kate, Andrea and the entire Kelly family, today 300 million American hearts are joined together with yours.  We grieve with you.  We honor you.  And we pledge to you that we will always remember Robert and what he did for all of us.  Thank you, John.  (Applause.)  The Kelly family represents military families across the country who carry the burden of freedom on their shoulders. Secretary Kelly is joined today by his son-in-law, Jake, a Wounded Warrior.  And the Secretary’s son, Johnnie, will soon leave on his fifth deployment.  It is because of families like yours that all of our families can live in safety and live in peace.To every Gold Star family who honors us with your presence, you lost sons and daughters, husbands and wives, mothers and fathers.  They each had their own names, their own stories, their own beautiful dreams.  But they were all angels sent to us by God, and they all share one title in common -- and that is the title of hero.  (Applause.)  Real heroes.  Though they were here only a brief time before God called them home, their legacy will endure forever.General Douglas MacArthur once said that “the soldier who is called upon to offer and to give his life for his country is the noblest development of mankind.”  Here at this hallowed shrine, we honor the noblest among us -- the men and women who paid the ultimate price for victory and for freedom.  We pay tribute to those brave souls who raced into gunfire, roared into battle, and ran into hell to face down evil.  They made their sacrifice not for fame, or for money, or even for glory -- but for country.We are privileged to be joined today by a man whose life demonstrates the values of service and sacrifice:  Senator Bob Dole, here with his wife, Senator Elizabeth Dole.  (Applause.)   Senator Dole fought bravely in World War II, and was severely wounded by German fire.  In just a few weeks, Bob will be celebrating his 94th birthday.  (Applause.)    And, Bob, I know I speak for millions of grateful Americans when I say thank you.  (Applause.)  Thank you, Bob.  We thank you not only for your service, but for helping us to remember your fallen comrades and the countless American patriots who gave their lives in the Second World War.Since the first volley of gunfire in the Revolution, brave Americans in every generation have answered the call of duty and won victory for freedom in its hour of need.  Today, a new generation of American patriots are fighting to win the battle against terrorism -- risking their lives to protect our citizens from an enemy that uses the murder of innocents to wage war on humanity itself.We are joined today by the wife of Specialist Christopher Horton, who rests on these so beautiful grounds.  As Jane tells us, Chris “was a man who loved his country with every part of his being.”In 2008, Chris enlisted in the Oklahoma Army National Guard.  He trained as a sniper, becoming known as one of the best shots anywhere at any time.  He was a talented, tough guy.  While Chris was in the National Guard, he was also a volunteer police officer.  In everything he did, he was thinking about how he could serve God, serve his family and serve his country.  In 2011, he deployed for the first time to Afghanistan. Chris knew his job was one of the most dangerous there was, but he was determined to go after the enemy at any cost to himself.  His missions helped target and kill terrorists who sought to destroy innocent people.  Just three months into his first deployment, Chris was near the Pakistan border, trying to eliminate an enemy cell that was doing so much damage and that was planting deadly roadside bombs against his unit and the units of many others.  Standing watch with his comrades, he died in the ensuing gun battle with enemy forces.  Chris sacrificed his life to protect his fellow soldiers -- and to protect all Americans.  He was awarded the Purple Heart and Bronze Star for his courage. At only 26 years old, Chris secured his place in our hearts for eternity. Jane, America, grieves with you.  Our whole entire nation sends you our support, our strength, and our deep, deep love.  You lost your husband, and America lost a hero.  And together, we will preserve his memory -- today, tomorrow, and always.  Thank you, Jane.  (Applause.)  Thank you, Jane.  Thank you, Jane.  (Applause.)  Thank you, Jane. We are also joined today by David and Rose Byers, the parents of Major Andrew Byers.  As a boy, Andrew dreamed of the chance to attend the United States Military Academy at West Point.  He worked hard, he earned that chance, and he graduated at the top of his class.  He became the commander of a Special HALO team, leading his fellow soldiers out of aircraft, hurtling into dangerous and unknown territory.  About this time last year, Andrew was sent on his third combat deployment.  This time he went to Afghanistan.  On November 3rd, he was one of 10 Special Forces operators to land by helicopter near a Taliban safe haven in northern Afghanistan. They trekked through a mile of waist-deep mud and climbed a steep cliff before finally reaching the village that they wanted to reach.  There, a night-long battle ensued.  Andrew and his team fought off wave after wave after wave of enemy fighters.  A grenade detonated, and as the Taliban began to surround the American and Afghan forces, Andrew ran through the smoke and through the hail of bullets to rescue an Afghan soldier.  In the midst of this torrent of gunfire and danger, Andrew worked heroically to open a gateway and get his men to safety -- risking his life to save theirs.  And he did it.  Unbelievably, he did.  But in saving those lives, Andrew was killed right then and there by enemy fire.  Andrew has since been awarded the Silver Star for gallantry in battle.  To his parents, David and Rose, we stand in awe of your son and his courageous sacrifice.  On behalf of the American people, I express to you our everlasting gratitude for what your son did for his country, for his comrades, and for all of us.  Andrew’s father has said that he holds on to the promise of Joshua Chapter 1, Verse 9:  “The Lord your God will be with you wherever you go.”   Thank you.  Thank you.  (Applause.)  Thank you.  Thank you.  (Applause.)  What a man he was.To every Gold Star family, God is with you, and your loved ones are with Him.  They died in wars so that we could live in peace.  I believe that God has a special place in heaven for those who laid down their lives so that others may live free from fear and this horrible oppression.  Now let us pledge to make the most of that freedom that they so gallantly and brilliantly fought for and they died to protect. Let us also pledge to tell the stories of Robert, Chris, Andrew, and all of America’s fallen warriors today and for the next 1,000 years.  (Applause.)And while we cannot know the extent of your pain, what we do know is that our gratitude to them and to you is boundless and undying.  Boundless and undying.  We'll always be there.  Thank you.  (Applause.)  Their stories are now woven into the soul of our nation, into the Stars and Stripes on our flag, and into the beating hearts of our great, great people.  Today we also hold a special vigil for heroes whose story we cannot tell because their names are known to God alone -- the unknown soldiers.  We do not know where they came from, who they left behind, or what they hoped to be.  But we do know what they did.  They fought and they died in a great and noble act of loyalty and love to their families and to our country.  The letter written that is now famous -- one Civil War soldier captured it all and for all time.  He wrote to his wife, “If I do not return, my dear Sarah, never forget how much I love you, nor that when my last breath escapes me on the battlefield, it will whisper your name.”  That is the love we hear whispering throughout this sacred place and from every tombstone on these hallowed grounds.  It is the love that binds this earth beneath us and it bleeds from the hearts of all of those who died so that we might live free.  We can never replace them.  We can never repay them.  But we can always remember.  And today, that is what we are doing -- we remember.  Words cannot wipe away the tears or bring back those smiling faces.  But if Americans just take the time to look into your eyes and tell you how much we thank you and how dearly we pray for you and how truly we love you, then hopefully you can find solace through your pain.  And every time you see the sun rise over this blessed land please know your brave sons and daughters pushed away the night and delivered for us all that great and glorious dawn. Thank you.  God bless you.  God bless our fallen heroes.  God bless their families.  God bless our military.  And G

And thank you to Prime Minister Netanyahu.  And I also want to thank Sara for hosting us last night in really a very unforgettable dinner.  We had a great time.  We talked about a lot of very, very important things.  And thank you to Ambassador David Friedman and Mrs. Friedman for joining us, along with a number of very good friends who have come from our country to yours, as we reaffirm the unshakable bond between the United States of America and Israel.  Thank you.  (Applause.)  I'd like to begin my remarks today by sending the thoughts and prayers of the entire American people to the victims of the terrorist attack in Manchester.  You know -- you've all been watching.  You've seen just a horrible thing going on.  I want to send our condolences to the many families who lost their loved ones.  Horrific, horrific injuries.  Terrible.  Dozens of innocent people, beautiful young children savagely murdered in this heinous attack upon humanity.  I repeat again that we must drive out the terrorists and the extremists from our midst, obliterate this evil ideology, and protect and defend our citizens and people of the world.  (Applause.)  All civilized nations much be united in this effort.  This trip is focused on that goal:  bringing nations together around the goal of defeating the terrorism that threatens the world, and crushing the hateful ideology that drives it so hard and seems to be driving it so fast.It is a privilege to stand here in this national museum, in the ancient city of Jerusalem, to address the Israeli people and all people in the Middle East who yearn for security, prosperity and peace.    Jerusalem is a sacred city.  Its beauty, splendor, and heritage are like no other place on Earth.  (Applause.)  What a heritage.  What a heritage.  The ties of the Jewish people to this Holy Land are ancient and eternal.  (Applause.)  They date back thousands of years, including the reign of King David whose star now flies proudly on Israel’s white and blue flag.Yesterday, I visited the Western Wall, and marveled at the monument to God’s presence and man’s perseverance.  I was humbled to place my hand upon the wall and to pray in that holy space for wisdom from God.  I also visited and prayed at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, a site revered by Christians throughout the world.  I laid a wreath at Yad Vashem, honoring, remembering, and mourning the six million Jews who were murdered in the Holocaust.  I pledged right then and there what I pledge again today:  the words ""never again.""  (Applause.)  Israel is a testament to the unbreakable spirit of the Jewish people.  From all parts of this great country, one message resounds, and that is the message of hope.  Down through the ages, the Jewish people have suffered persecution, oppression, and even those who have sought their destruction.  But, through it all, they have endured and, in fact, they have thrived.  I stand in awe of the accomplishments of the Jewish people, and I make this promise to you:  My administration will always stand with Israel.  (Applause.)  Thank you very much.    Through your hardships, you have created one of the most abundant lands anywhere in the world -- a land that is rich not only in history, culture, and opportunity, but especially in spirit.  This museum where we are gathered today tells the story of that spirit.  From the two Holy Temples, to the glorious heights of Masada, we see an incredible story of faith and perseverance.  That faith is what inspired Jews to believe in their destiny, to overcome their despair, and to build here -- right here -- a future that others dared not even to dream. In Israel, not only are Jews free to till the soil, teach their children, and pray to God in the ancient land of their fathers -- and they love this land, and they love God -- but Muslims, Christians, and people of all faiths are free to live and worship according to their conscience, and to follow their dreams, right here.Today, gathered with friends, I call upon all people -- Jews, Christians, Muslims, and every faith, every tribe, every creed -- to draw inspiration from this ancient city, to set aside our sectarian differences, to overcome oppression and hatred, and to give all children the freedom and hope and dignity written into our souls. Earlier this week, I spoke at a very historic summit in Saudi Arabia.  I was hosted by King Salman -- a very wise man.  There, I urged our friends in the Muslim world to join us in creating stability, safety and security.  And I was deeply encouraged by the desire of many leaders to join us in cooperation toward these shared and vital goals.  Conflict cannot continue forever.  The only question is when nations will decide that they have had enough -- enough bloodshed, enough killing.  That historic summit represents a new opportunity for people throughout the Middle East to overcome sectarian and religious divisions, to extinguish the fires of extremism, and to find common ground and shared responsibility in making the future of this region so much better than it is right now.  Change must come from within.   It can only come from within.  No mother or father wants their children to grow up in a world where terrorists roam free, schoolchildren are murdered, and their loved ones are taken.  No child is born with prejudice in their heart.  No one should teach young boys and girls to hate and to kill.  No civilized nation can tolerate the massacre of innocents with chemical weapons.My message to that summit was the same message I have for you:  We must build a coalition of partners who share the aim of stamping out extremists and violence, and providing our children a peaceful and hopeful future.  But a hopeful future for children in the Middle East requires the world to fully recognize the vital role of the State of Israel.  (Applause.)  And, on behalf of the United States, we pledge to stand by you and defend our shared values so that together we can defeat terrorism and create safety for all of God’s children.  (Applause.) Israelis have experienced firsthand the hatred and terror of radical violence.  Israelis are murdered by terrorists wielding knives and bombs.  Hamas and Hezbollah launch rockets into Israeli communities where schoolchildren have to be trained to hear the sirens and run to the bomb shelters -- with fear, but with speed.  ISIS targets Jewish neighborhoods, synagogues, and storefronts.  And Iran’s leaders routinely call for Israel’s destruction.  Not with Donald J. Trump, believe me.  (Applause.)  Thank you.  I like you too.  (Laughter.)   Despite these challenges, Israel is thriving as a sovereign nation, and no international body should question the contributions Israel makes to the region and, indeed, the world.  Today, let us pray for that peace and for a more hopeful future across the Middle East.There are those who present a false choice.  They say that we must choose between supporting Israel and supporting Arab and Muslim nations in the region.  That is completely wrong.  All decent people want to live in peace, and all humanity is threatened by the evils of terrorism.  Diverse nations can unite around the goal of protecting innocent life, upholding human dignity, and promoting peace and stability in the region.  My administration is committed to pursuing such a coalition, and we have already made substantial progress during this trip.  We know, for instance, that both Israelis and Palestinians seek lives of hope for their children.  And we know that peace is possible if we put aside the pain and disagreements of the past and commit together to finally resolving this crisis, which has dragged on for nearly half a century or more. As I have repeatedly said, I am personally committed to helping Israelis and Palestinians achieve a peace agreement, and I had a meeting this morning with President Abbas and can tell you that the Palestinians are ready to reach for peace.  I know you’ve heard it before.  I am telling you -- that’s what I do.  They are ready to reach for peace.In my meeting with my very good friend, Benjamin, I can tell you also that he is reaching for peace.  He wants peace.  He loves people.  He especially loves the Israeli people.  Benjamin Netanyahu wants peace.Making peace, however, will not be easy.  We all know that.  Both sides will face tough decisions.  But with determination, compromise, and the belief that peace is possible, Israelis and Palestinians can make a deal.  But even as we work toward peace, we will build strength to defend our nations.  The United States is firmly committed to keep Iran from developing a nuclear weapon and halting their support of terrorists and militias.  (Applause.)  So we are telling you right now that Iran will not have nuclear weapons.  (Applause.) America’s security partnership with Israel is stronger than ever.  Under my administration, you see the difference -- big, big beautiful difference -- (laughter and applause) -- including the Iron Dome missile defense program, which has been keeping the Israeli people safe from short-range rockets launched by Hezbollah and Hamas, and David’s Sling, which guards against long range missiles.  It is my hope that someday, very soon, Israeli children will never need to rush towards shelters again as sirens ring out loud and clear.Finally, the United States is proud that Israeli Air Force pilots are flying the incredible, new American F-35 planes.  (Applause.)  There is nothing in the world like them to defend their nation, and it was wonderful to see these mighty aircraft in the skies over Israel recently as you celebrated the 69th anniversary of Israel’s independence. But even as we strengthen our partnership in practice, let us always remember our highest ideals.  Let us never forget that the bond between our two nations is woven together in the hearts of our people, and their love of freedom, hope, and dignity for every man and every woman.  Let us dream of a future where Jewish, Muslim, and Christian children can grow up together and live together in trust, harmony, tolerance, and respect.  The values that are practiced in Israel have inspired millions and millions of people all across the world.  The conviction of Theodor Herzl rings true today:  “Whatever we attempt there for our own benefit will rebound mightily and beneficially to the good of all mankind.”  As we stand in Jerusalem, we see pilgrims of all faiths coming to this land to walk on this hallowed ground.  Jews place the prayers from their hearts in the stone blocks of the beautiful Western Wall.  Christians pray in the pews of an ancient church.  Muslims answer the call to prayer at their holy sites.  This city, like no other place in the world, reveals the longing of human hearts to know and to worship God.Jerusalem stands as a reminder that life can flourish against any odds.  When we look around this city -- so beautiful -- and we see people of all faiths engaged in reverent worship, and schoolchildren learning side-by-side, and men and women lifting up the needy and forgotten, we see that God’s promise of healing has brought goodness to so many lives.  We see that the people of this land had the courage to overcome the oppression and injustice of the past and to live in the freedom God intends for every person on this Earth.Today, in Jerusalem, we pray and we hope that children around the world will be able to live without fear, to dream without limits, and to prosper without violence.  I ask this land of promise to join me to fight our common enemies, to pursue our shared values, and to protect the dignity of every child of God.Thank you.  God bless you.  God bless the State of Israel.  And God bless "
2017-05-23;https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/05/23/remarks-president-trump-yad-vashem;Remarks by President Trump at Yad Vashem;  Thank you, Prime Minister Netanyahu, Sara Netanyahu, Chairman Avner Shalev, and Rabbi Israel Meir Lau for hosting us for this moving wreath-laying ceremony.We are here at Yad Vashem to honor the memory of six million Jews murdered in the Holocaust.  Two-thirds of the Jews in Europe were sent to their deaths.  Words can never describe the bottomless depths of that evil, or the scope of the anguish and destruction.It was history’s darkest hour.  Millions of innocent, wonderful and beautiful lives -- men, women and children -- were extinguished as part of a systematic attempt to eliminate the Jewish people.  It was the most savage crime against God and his children.  And it is our solemn duty to remember, to mourn, to grieve and to honor every single life that was so cruelly and viciously taken.As Elie Wiesel said: “For the dead and the living, we must bear witness.”  These words should be carved into the conscience of humanity forever.  Only when we remember the families who were torn apart from everyone they loved, who suffered that terrible darkness and evil, who endured the unbearable horror of the Holocaust -- only then can we prevent this agony from ever repeating.This place, and this entire nation, are a testament to the unbreakable spirit of the Jewish people -- and the hope that light can shine the path beyond the darkness.  Through persecution, oppression, death, and destruction, the Jewish people have persevered.  They have thrived.  They’ve become so successful in so many places.  And they have enlightened the world.  The State of Israel is a strong and soaring monument to the solemn pledge we repeat and affirm:  Never again.From the depths of the suffering, the Jewish people have built a mighty nation -- and the Star of David waves proudly above this cherished land.As long as we refuse to be silent in the face of evil, as long as we refuse to dim the light of truth in the midst of darkness, as long as we refuse to become bystanders to barbarity, then we know that goodness, peace and justice will ultimately prevail.With sadness for the lives and dreams that were stolen from this Earth, with determination to always keep the memories of the victims alive, and with resolve to confront evil wherever it threatens, we ask God to give us the strength, wisdom and courage to chart the righteous path.Thank you.  God bless the memory of the perished.  God bless the survivors.  God bless the Jewish people.  And God bless the Stat

2017-05-17;https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/05/17/remarks-president-trump-united-states-coast-guard-academy-commencement;Remarks by President Trump at United States Coast Guard Academy Commencement Ceremony;Thank you very much.  Thank you, John.  (Applause.)  Thank you.  Thank you, and congratulations to the Class of 2017.  Great job.  And, General Kelly, I want to thank you for your leadership as the Coast Guard’s Service Secretary.  You’ve really been something very, very special to us as a country, and to me and our administration.  You’ve done throughout your entire life an incredible job defending your country.  Thank you very much, John.  (Applause.)  And John and all of his folks are also doing an incredible job protecting our homeland and our border.  And I’m thrilled that my first address to the Service Academy is the graduation ceremony for the United States Coast Guard.  Believe me, it’s a great honor.  (Applause.)  I’ve been here before and it’s a very, very special place.  Every cadet graduating today, as your Commander-in-Chief, it is truly my honor to welcome you aboard.  (Applause.)  And you should take a moment to celebrate this incredible achievement.Governor Malloy, thank you for being here.  Governor, thank you.  We’re glad you could join us.  And I know how busy the governors are nowadays, and they’re out there fighting.  It’s never easy.  Budgets are a little tight, but we’re doing a job, all of us are doing a job, working together.  I want to also thank Admiral Zookunft and his leadership.  His leadership has been amazing.  Today’s graduates will be fortunate to serve under such capable and experienced Commandant. He really is fantastic.  Thanks also to Admiral Rendon, the Academy Superintendent.  Admiral, I understand you come from a true Coast Guard family.  Two brothers, a nephew, a cousin have all passed through these halls.  That’s very impressive.  I guess you like the place, right?  (Applause.)  Somebody in your family has been doing something right, I can tell you that.  I’m sure they all are very proud, just as we are very proud of the fine young officers who are graduating today, Admiral, on your watch.  I would also like to take this opportunity to express our appreciation to all of the parents and the grandparents and family members who have supported these amazing graduates.  Give your parents and everyone a hand.  Come on.  (Applause.)  Because America has families like yours, and we’ll keep all of those families safe and very, very secure.  You’re keeping your families safe now.  If you are not already, you’re about to become military families.  So, starting today, I hope you feel the full gratitude of our nation.  These fine young cadets are about to take their rightful place on the front line of defense for the United States of America.  Cadets, you deserve not only the congratulations but the gratitude of each and every American, and we all salute you. (Applause.)  A proud nation.  And you’re a part of a very, very proud nation which salutes the 195 199 cadets of the Coast Guard Academy Class of 2017.  Good job.  (Applause.)  And I understand from the admirals that this has been a very special class.  You’ve been trained here to handle the toughest of situations, the hardest of moments really that you can experience, and the hardest in people’s lives, and to help the weak in their hour of need.  But even for the Coast Guard, this class has been exceptionally dedicated to public service.  You served breakfast at the local food bank every single weekday.  You rebuilt a home with Habitat for Humanity.  Last year, you led cadets in donating a total of 24,000 hours -- a lot of time -- to community service.  You’ve done amazing work.  And in the true Coast Guard fashion, you had fewer people and fewer resources, but you accomplished the objectives, and you did it with skill and with pride -- and, I’d like to say, under budget and ahead of schedule.  We’re doing a lot of that now in the United States government.  (Applause.)  We’re doing a lot of that.  I won’t talk about how much I saved you on the F-35 fighter jet.  I won’t even talk about it.  Or how much we’re about to save you on the Gerald Ford, the aircraft carrier.  That had a little bit of an overrun problem before I got here, you know that.  Still going to have an overrun problem.  We came in when it was finished.  But we’re going to save some good money.  And when we build the new aircraft carriers they’re going to be built under budget and ahead of schedule, just remember that.  (Applause.)  That will allow us to build more.  Now, of course, there are always a few slip-ups from time to time -- you know that.  For example, I understand that once or twice, First Class Cadet Bruce Kim -- where’s Bruce?  (Applause.) Where’s Bruce?  Oh, Bruce, how do you do this to yourself, Bruce? (Laughter.)  As Regimental Parking Officer, might have accidentally caused a few tickets to be issued or a few of your cars to be booted.  Bruce, what’s going on with you?  (Laughter.) But, Cadets, from this day forward, we want everyone to have a clean slate in life.  That includes Bruce, right? (Laughter.) And so, for any oversights or small violations that might have occurred this year, as tradition demands, I hereby absolve every cadet serving restrictions for minor offenses.  Now, Bruce -- stand up once again, Bruce.  (Laughter.)  They saved you, Bruce, because they all wanted me to do that, okay?  Thank you, Bruce.  Congratulations, Bruce.  (Applause.)  Good job.  By the way, Bruce, don't worry about it.  That's the tradition.  I was forced to do that.  You know that.  Don't worry.  (Laughter.)    This is truly an amazing group of cadets that are here today for commission.  You could have gone to school anywhere you wanted -- and with very, very few responsibilities by comparison. Instead, you chose the path of service.  You chose hard work, high standards, and a very noble mission -- to save lives, defend the homeland, and protect America’s interests around the world.  You chose the Coast Guard.  Good choice.  Good choice.  (Applause.)  You’ve learned skills they don’t teach at other schools right here on the grounds of this academy and also on your larger campus -- the open sea.  That is a large, large campus, isn’t it? A beautiful campus.  But the greatest lesson you’ve learned at this proud institution is the knowledge you've learned about yourself.  It’s the knowledge that each and every one of you is something very special -- you are leaders.  From the first stormy days of your Swab Summer to your final weeks as a first class cadet, you have been expected to take responsibility, to make decisions, and to act.  And I -- like all leaders, that's exactly what you have to do.  You have to act, and you have to act properly.  And you have to learn how to act under great, great pressure.  You're all going to be under great pressure.  You have to learn how to respond and to act under great pressure.Just days from now, you will put this vital skill into the service of your ships, your sectors, and your country.  You’ll serve as deck watch officers on our amazing Coast Guard cutters. You’ll bring law and order to the dangerous waters as boating officers.  You will block illegal shipments of cash, weapons and drugs.  You will battle the scourge of human trafficking -- something that people haven’t been talking about.  One of the big, big plagues of the world.  Not our country only -- the world.  Human trafficking.  Americans will place their trust in your leadership, just as they have trusted in generations of Coast Guard men and women, with respect for your skill, with awe at your courage, and with the knowledge that you will always be ready.  You are Always Ready.    Not only will our citizens trust in your leadership, your commanders will trust you as well.  The Coast Guard is the gold standard in delegating decision-making down to chain command.  So just as your instructors have at the academy, your Coast Guard commanders will explain their vision, and then they will trust you to get the job done.  Just like I, as your President, will also trust you to get the job done. It’s amazing to think of the adventures that are about to begin for you.  Across the country this month, millions of other students are graduating high school, college.  Many others are wondering, just what am I going to do.  They're saying to themselves, what are they going to do.  You know what you're going to do.  Many, many students are graduating from college right now.  They're saying, what am I going to do?  Where am I going to go to work?  You know it.  You picked a good one, by the way.  You picked a beautiful one, a good one, and we're really proud to have you, I can tell you.  (Applause.) Years from now, some of them may look back and ask themselves whether they’ve made the right choice, whether they’ve made the most of the opportunities they’ve been given.  In the Coast Guard, you will face many challenges and many threats, but one thing you will never have to face is that question of what will I do.  When you look back, you won’t doubt.  You know exactly how you spent your time -- saving lives.I look at your admirals, I look at General Kelly, I look at some of the great people in service, and I want to tell you, they're excited about life.  They love what they do.  They love the country.  They love protecting our country, and they love what they do.  Is that right?  Good.  I didn't think anyone was going to say no.  (Laughter.)  That would have ruined our speech, right?  (Laughter.)  They're great people.  You always know just what you’ll be:  the leaders and officers of the United States Coast Guard.  (Applause.) And when they see your uniform, everyone in the world will know exactly what that means.  What standard -- and really if you think of it, when you talk about the great sailors, and the great sailors of the world, we have them.  But what stranded sailor doesn’t feel relief when those red racing stripes break the horizon?  What drifting soul at sea, with only a short time left to live, doesn’t rejoice at the sound of those chopper blades overhead, coming back and coming down to rescue them from death? What poison-peddling drug runner, the scourge of our country, doesn’t tremble with fear when the might of the Coast Guard comes bearing down on them?  In each case, we know the reason --America's lifesaving service is on the way.  The Coast Guard is truly vital to the United States Armed Forces and truly vital to our great country.  (Applause.)  Out of the five branches of our Armed Services, it's only the Coast Guard that has the power to break through 21 feet of rock-solid Arctic ice, right?  You’re the only ones.  And I’m proud to say that under my administration, as you just heard, we will be building the first new heavy icebreakers the United States has seen in over 40 years.  We’re going to build many of them.  (Applause.)  We need them.  We need them.The Coast Guard stands watch at our ports, patrols our waterways, and protects our infrastructure.  You defend America in a world of massive and very grave threats.  Soon, some of you will be leading boardings of suspicious vessels, searching for the most deadly weapons, and detaining criminals to keep our people safe.  Others of you will work with partners in scores of countries around the globe, bringing in the full power of the United States Coast Guard right up to those distant shores.  And some of those shores are very far away.To secure our borders from drug cartels, human smugglers, and terrorist threats, Coast Guard Cutters patrol more than 1,500 miles below our southern border.  A lot of people didn’t know that.  When enormous pride hits your heart, you realize that it’s with this great skill and tremendous speed, our Coast Guard men and women interdict dangerous criminals and billions and billions of dollars' worth of illegal narcotics every single year.  Your helicopters launch from the decks of world-class national security cutters, and they chase drug smugglers at speeds far in excess of 50 knots.In rough seas, at high speeds, our incredible Coast Guard snipers take their aim at the smugglers' engines.  And time after time, they take out the motors on the first shot.  They don’t like wasting the bullets, right?  (Applause.)  They actually don’t.  Your slice through roaring storms, and through pouring rain and crashing waves is a place where few other people will ever venture -- exciting.  Exciting.  But you have to have it in your heart.  You have to love it.  You love it.  In the Coast Guard, you don't run from danger, you chase it. And you are deployed in support of operations in theaters of conflict all around the world.  But not only do you defend American security, you also protect American prosperity.  It's a mission that goes back to the earliest days of the Revenue Cutter Service.  You’ve read about that and studied that.Today, the Coast Guard helps keep our waters open for Americans to do business.  It keeps our rivers flowing with commerce.  And it keeps our ports churning with American exports. You help billions and billions of dollars in goods to navigate our country every day.  You are the only federal presence on our inland waterways.  You police the arteries we need to rebuild this country and to bring prosperity back to our heartland.  And we are becoming very, very prosperous again.  You can see that.Think of the glorious mission that awaits.  You will secure our harbors, our waterways, and our borders.  You will partner with our allies to advance our security interests at home and abroad.  And you will pursue the terrorists, you will stop the drug smugglers, and you will seek to keep out all who would do harm to our country -- all who can never, ever love our country. Together, we have the same mission, and your devotion and dedication makes me truly proud to be your Commander-in-Chief.  (Applause.)  Thank you. Now, I want to take this opportunity to give you some advice.  Over the course of your life, you will find that things are not always fair.  You will find that things happen to you that you do not deserve and that are not always warranted.  But you have to put your head down and fight, fight, fight.  Never, ever, ever give up.  Things will work out just fine.  Look at the way I’ve been treated lately -- (laughter) -- especially by the media.  No politician in history -- and I say this with great surety -- has been treated worse or more unfairly.  You can’t let them get you down.  You can’t let the critics and the naysayers get in the way of your dreams.  (Applause.)  I guess that’s why I -- thank you.  I guess that’s why we won.  Adversity makes you stronger.  Don’t give in.  Don’t back down.  And never stop doing what you know is right.  Nothing worth doing ever, ever, ever came easy.  And the more righteous your right, the more opposition that you will face.  I’ve accomplished a tremendous amount in a very short time as President.  Jobs pouring back in to our country.  A brand-new Supreme Court justice -- who’s going to be fantastic for 45 years -- (applause) -- a historic investment in our military.  Border crossings -- thank you to our General -- are down more than 70 percent in just a short period of time -- a total record, by the way, by a lot.  (Applause.)  We’ve saved the Second Amendment, expanded service for our veterans -- we are going to take care of our veterans like they’ve never been taken care of before.  (Applause.)  I’ve loosened up the strangling environmental chains wrapped around our country and our economy, chains so tight that you couldn’t do anything -- that jobs were going down.  We were losing business.  We’re loosening it up.  We’ve begun plans and preparations for the border wall, which is going along very, very well.  We’re working on major tax cuts for all.  We are going to give you the largest tax cut in the history of our country if we get it the way we want it, and we’re going to give you major tax reform.  (Applause.)  And we’re also getting closer and closer, day by day, to great healthcare for our citizens.  (Applause.)  And we are setting the stage right now for many, many more things to come.  And the people understand what I’m doing, and that’s the most important thing.  I didn’t get elected to serve the Washington media or special interests.  I got elected to serve the forgotten men and women of our country, and that’s what I’m doing.  (Applause.)  I will never stop fighting for you, and I will never stop fighting for the American people.As you leave this academy to embark on your exciting new voyage, I am heading on a very crucial journey as well.  In a few days, I will make my first trip abroad as President.  With the safety, security, and interests of the American people as my priority, I will strengthen old friendships and will seek new partners -- but partners who also help us.  Not partners who take and take and take, partners who help, and partners who help pay for whatever we are doing and all of the good we’re doing for them -- which is something that a lot of people have not gotten used to and they just can’t get used to it.  I say, get used to it, folks.  (Applause.)  I’ll ask them to unite for a future of peace and opposition opportunity for our peoples and the peoples of the world. First, in Saudi Arabia, where I'll speak with Muslim leaders and challenge them to fight hatred and extremism, and embrace a peaceful future for their faith.  And they’re looking very much forward to hearing what we -- as your representative -- we have to say.  We have to stop radical Islamic terrorism.  (Applause.) Then in Israel, I'll reaffirm our unbreakable alliance with the Jewish state.  In Rome, I will talk with Pope Francis about the contributions of Christian teachings to the world.  Finally, I’ll attend the NATO Summit in Brussels and the G7 in Sicily -- to promote security, prosperity and peace all over the world.I’ll meet scores of leader, and honor the holiest sites of these three great religions.  And everywhere I go, I will carry the inspiration I take from you each day, from your courage and determination to do whatever is required save and protect American lives.  Save and protect American lives.  We want security.  You're going to give us security.  (Applause.)  In just one example, we see how priceless that gift of life is to the people you touch every day.  A few years ago, a Coast Guard helicopter and rescue swimmer took off in the direction of three terrified fishermen who clung to their sinking and burning vessel.  That day, our Coast Guard heroes did their jobs well.  They flew over the sea, despite tremendous danger, and extended a helping hand at the moment it was most urgently needed.  There was very little time left. But that’s not the most remarkable part of that story.  As one Coast Guard swimmer put it, you do that stuff all the time.  You do it every hour of the day.  Something is happening all the time with the United States Coast Guard.  You do an amazing job. A remarkable thing happened with that rescue, but when you think of it, you do those rescues all the time.  There, the Vietnamese fishing captain grabbed the swimmer’s hand.  He looked his Coast Guard rescuer in the eye, and said: “I was asking God to please let me live....I need to see my kids. Please, God, please, let me live so that I can see my kids.  Then God sent me you.”  That's what he said.  (Applause.)  To every new officer, and to every new Coast Guard member here today, or out protecting life around the world on some of the roughest waters anywhere, you truly are doing God’s work.  What a grateful heart you must all have.  Because it is with my very grateful heart, and America’s cheers for the Coast Guard -- and America cheers for you often -- but we wish you good luck.  As your Commander-in-Chief, I thank you.  I salute you.  And I, once again, congratulate the Coast Guard Class of 2017.  (Applause.)  God bless you.  God bless the Coast Guard.  And God bless the United States of America.  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  (Applause.)  Thank you very much.  Thank you, everybody.  Great honor.  Good luc
2017-05-15;https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/05/15/remarks-president-trump-36th-annual-national-peace-officers-memorial;Remarks by President Trump at the 36th Annual National Peace Officers' Memorial Service;"Thank you, everybody.  (Applause.)  Wow, what a beautiful introduction.  Thank you, Chuck.  That was above and beyond.  That's the way I'm going to be with you, too.  And it's a great honor -- thank you very much -- it's a great honor to address America’s heroes on this most solemn occasion.Words cannot express the depths of our gratitude, but I hope that our actions will show you how deeply we care and how strongly we feel about protecting those who protect us.  America stands strong with our men and women in blue.  Believe me, we stand strong together.I want to recognize Jim Pasco, Linda Hennie, Chaplain Wiggins, and everyone at the Fraternal Order of Police for all that you do to protect the law enforcement of this country and all of our communities.  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  (Applause.)  As long as I’m President, you will always find an open door to the White House.  And you’ve already found it, believe me.  Mr. Vice President, Cabinet Secretaries, and members of Congress, we are gathered here today at the U.S. Capitol to pay tribute to those brave law enforcement officers who gave their lives in the line of duty.  On this Peace Officers’ Memorial Day, we thank God for having blessed so many of us with such incredible heroes -- and we pledge our solidarity with their families and loved ones.  And many of those great families and survivors are here with us today, and I'd love you to stand up.  Families and survivors -- what great, incredible people.  (Applause.)  And your loved ones are looking down on you right now, believe me, and they’re very proud.  Thank you.  (Applause.)  Thank you.  Thank you very much for being here.  Whatever you need, we are here for you, and we are praying for you.As I look out today at this amazing assembly of police, detectives, marshals and sheriffs, I want to make all of you remember and heed this promise:  I will always support the incredible men and women of law enforcement as much as you have always supported me.  And you did, big league.  (Applause.)   Your presence here reminds us all of what is at stake on this sacred day of remembrance.  Each May, during Police Week, new names of fallen police officers are added to the National Law Enforcement Memorial.  This year, 394 brave souls join the over 20,000 men and women who gave up their lives in the line of duty to protect us.The names of these heroes are not only carved into that wall, but carved into the hearts of the American people.  And by the way, the American people love you, more than you will ever know.  I can tell you that.  (Applause.)  Though your loved ones left us much too soon, the memory of their courage will live on forever.  To see so many names together is to gain only a small glimpse of the debt America owes to those who protect our cities and police on our streets.We are privileged this morning to be joined by families of the fallen, to whom we owe that ultimate loyalty.  So many people -- even back here.  Please know that you do not grieve alone.  Though we cannot fathom the depths of your loss, nor fully appreciate the bond that forms in the precinct and between partners on the beat, your sadness is left and felt by all of us.  Every drop of blood spilled from our heroes in blue is a wound inflicted upon the whole country.  And every heartache known by your families in law enforcement is a sorrow shared by the entire family of the American nation.No one asked these selfless men and women to enlist in this righteous cause, or to enroll as foot soldiers in the eternal struggle against crime and violence.  They joined the cause because their hearts were big and full of amazing courage.  They joined because they cared so deeply for the innocent and helpless and forgotten.  They put on the uniform because they believed to the very core of their souls, that it was their mission in life to serve and to protect.As the Bible tells us, there is no greater love than to lay down one’s life for one’s friends.  The names and stories on that wall are each a testament to this pure and unselfish love.  And that’s what it is -- pure and unselfish love.  And it is our duty as a people and as a nation to prove worthy of their sacrifice.  And that begins with showing our police the appreciation they have earned a thousand times over.  (Applause.) Living in New York, I gained a deep appreciation and lasting admiration for law enforcement.  Thousands of people are living and enjoying life today in New York who otherwise would be gone because our great police fought to bring safety to our streets and our communities.  The entire world witnessed the heroism of New York’s finest when they gave their lives on 9/11 -- I was there -- and sacrificed so much in that brutal, horrible aftermath.Now, as President, my highest duty is to keep America safe.  We will keep America safe.  (Applause.)  And included in safe means safe from crimes, safe from terrorism, and safe from all enemies, foreign and domestic.  At the center of that duty is the requirement to ensure that our law enforcement personnel are given the tools and resources they need to do their jobs and to come home to their families safely.  (Applause.) You are the Thin Blue Line between civilization and chaos.  You come from every community and all walks of life.  You are mothers and fathers and sons and daughters.  You rush into unknown danger, risking your lives for people you have never met, people you don’t know, performing your duty under the most difficult conditions -- and often without any thanks at all.Because you do not hear nearly enough, I want you to know that patriotic Americans of all backgrounds truly support and love our police.  (Applause.)  And a very sad thing is that many of today’s politicians don’t want to say that, don’t want to talk about that because it’s not politically correct or they think it might hurt them with the voters.  I will say it and I will talk about it proudly.  (Applause.)  I will make it the personal priority of my administration to ensure that our police are finally treated fairly, with honor and respect that they deserve.  (Applause.)  To all Americans watching this event today, next time you see a cop on the beat, take a moment to say two wonderful words, which they so readily deserve:  Thank you.  Thank you.  (Applause.)  As you all know much too well, we are living through an era in which our police have been subject to unfair defamation and vilification, and, even worse -- really, I mean, you see what's going on, you see what's going -- even worse, hostility and violence.  More officers were slain last year in ambushes than in any year in more than two decades, including -- and that's so incredible to even have to be speaking about this -- the beloved officers killed in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, in yet another murderous attack of law enforcement.  And we have some of those incredible families and survivors with us.  (Applause.)  Thank you. The attacks on our police are a stain on the very fabric of our society, and you are entitled to leadership at the highest level that will draw a bright line in the sand -- not a red line in the sand that isn’t gone over -- but a bright line in the sand.  And we will protect you.  That I can tell you.  And we will say, ""Enough is enough.""  (Applause.)  The attacks on our police must end, and they must end right now.  (Applause.)  And just to show you, by the way, how much I love our police, I said, oh, I'm going to need a hat because it's so windy today.  (Laughter.)  I said, when I got out of here, there's no way I'm going to put on this hat.  So we'll leave off the hat.   And this is for you, Micah.  That's for our beautiful Micah down there.  (Applause.)   We must also end the reckless words of incitement that give rise to danger and give rise to violence.  It is time to work with our cops, not against them, but to support them in making our streets safe; not to obstruct them -- which we're doing, we obstruct them.  It is time for all Americans, from all parties and beliefs, to join together in a simple goal to ensure that every child in America has the right to grow up in safety, security and peace.  True social justice means a future where every child, in every neighborhood, can play outside without fear, can walk home safely from school, and can live out the beautiful dreams that fill their heart -- like you, Mica.  (Applause.)  Freedom includes the right to be free -- and I mean totally free -- from crime and from violence.  MS-13 is going to be gone from our streets very soon, believe me.  (Applause.)  When policing is reduced, it’s often the poorest and most vulnerable Americans who are the first to suffer.  We have all seen the tragic rise in violence and crimes in many of our disadvantaged communities.  We’ve seen the unbearable horror of the shortcomings in Baltimore and Chicago that have cut short so many lives and so many beautiful, beautiful dreams.We cannot stand for such violence.  We cannot tolerate such pain.  We cannot, under any circumstances, any longer turn a blind eye to this suffering that's going on any longer.  And we won't.  (Applause.)  It's time for a grateful nation to join hands with our police and with our sheriffs to build the bridges of cooperation and trust, and to make our streets safer for every man, woman and child in America.  And someday, many of the young children you are protecting will decide that they, too, want to be police officers, that they, too, want to be sheriffs, they want to be cops -- they want to be cops.   They want to protect people because they love people.  And that's what they're going to do, and they're going to do it well.  They're going to be great at it.   As we seek this better and brighter future, we do so in the memory of these brave but gentle souls who were stolen from this world when they had so much left to share and to give not only to us but to their incredible families.Among them were Patrolman Justin Martin and Sergeant Tony Beminio, who were murdered last November.  Patrolman Martin was on the beat for less than a year, and leaves a beautiful, loving mom and dad, Randy and Jayne.  And thank you, Randy and Jayne.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  (Applause.)  Sergeant Beminio was a veteran of 11 years, and leaves behind his wife Zoe, and his wonderful children, Cameron, Haley and Maddox.  Ashley Guindon of the Prince William County Police fell in the line of duty on her very first day on the beat.  She swore the oath to protect and serve only a day prior to her death.  One day.  Officer Gwin-Don was dedicated to serving our nation -- she also served in the Marines.  And today, our thoughts are with her and her incredible mother, Sharon.  Thank you, Sharon.  Thank you.  Thank you, Sharon.  (Applause.)  Thank you.  I also had the privilege to meet at the White House just a little while ago with representatives from the Phoenix Police Department, New Jersey State Troopers, and the Ulster County Sheriff’s Department, who are mourning the deaths of State Trooper Frankie Williams and Sergeant Kerry Winters.  I had the chance to spend time with Officer Glasser’s beautiful family, his wife, Kristen, and his six-year-old son Micah -- who has my hat and he’s now with us.  Micah, stand up.  Kristen, please stand up.  Great people.  (Applause.)  Kristen and Micah, I know your beloved husband and father is looking down on you right now from heaven, and he is so proud of you both.  And thank you very much.  Thank you.  We also remember those incredible heroes who were so cruelly targeted for execution in Dallas, Texas -- rushing into a hail of gunfire, never to return.  Dallas Police Sergeant Michael Smith was a 27-year veteran of the Dallas Police.  He was decorated a law enforcement officer at the highest level, and even paid his own way to attend advanced training sessions.  He leaves behind his cherished wife, Heidi, and his loving daughters, Victoria and Caroline.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  (Applause.)  Last Friday, in Kirkersville, Ohio, a gunman shot and killed Steven Eric Disario.  He was the Chief of the Kirkersville Police Department.  He died responding to a hostage situation at a local nursing home.  Chief Disario leaves behind six children and his wife, who is expecting another child.  Our hearts break for the Chief’s family.  We love you all.  We love you all.  (Applause.)  Thank you.To every child in America who has lost a mom or a dad in the line of duty, I want you to know your parents are American heroes -- American heroes.  They died keeping us safe.  They are the pride of our nation.  And we will hold them in our hearts always and forever.  (Applause.)  Their sacrifice will never, ever be forgotten.To everyone in the audience here today, I want you to know that my administration is determined -- totally determined -- to restore law and order and justice for all Americans, and we're going to do it quickly.  (Applause.)  And that is why I’m so proud to be here today with Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Homeland Security Director John Kelly, two men who are deeply committed to the rule of law, to the rank-and-file officers who enforce it, and to bringing the violent criminals, drug dealers, and gang members to justice.  And I mean bring them to justice quickly.  Thank you very much for being here.  (Applause.) All of you at this ceremony, the men and women who police the streets, or who send our loved ones to work with a really very, very, sometimes worried or heavy heart -- every single day you do that -- you've seen and you've heard things that no one else should ever have to see or hear.  You bear this burden on our behalf.  You have witnessed the evil of those who derive pleasure from inflicting pain on the innocent.  You've seen a lot of that more recently than maybe ever before.  It’s going to stop.  And you've watched great, great people suffer unthinkable harm and unthinkable death.  America as a nation must always have the clarity to know the difference between good and evil, between right and wrong, and between those who uphold our laws and those who so easily break them.  We owe it to the fallen to act according to our best and highest ideals.  We owe it to their memory to put truth before politics, justice before agendas, and to put the safety and security of the American people above everything else.  (Applause.)  And we owe it to them to build a better future for all of America’s wonderful children.May today be the beginning of a new era of respect and appreciation for law enforcement.  May this ceremony bring new hope to those in search of healing, harmony and peace.  May Americans learn from the example of the heroes we have lost, and always remember to trust each other, work with each other, and love each other.And finally, and so importantly, may God bless you.  May God bless our police.  And may God bless the United States "

(Applause.)  And thanks to the leadership of President Donald Trump, welcome to the beginning of the end of Obamacare.  (Applause.)  It was March, 2010, seven years ago, Democrats passed a government takeover of healthcare.  And at that time, Republicans in Congress promised the American people that law would not stand.  Today, thanks to the perseverance, the determination, and the leadership of President Donald Trump, and all the support of those gathered here, we’ve taken a historic first step to repeal and replace Obamacare and finally give the American people the kind of healthcare they deserve.  (Applause.) So, today, with heartfelt gratitude for all he has done to keep his word to the American people, and for all he will do to continue to make America great again, it is my high honor and distinct privilege to introduce to you the President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump.  (Applause.) THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you, Mike.  (Applause.)  That’s the group.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  This really is the group.  What a great group of people.  and they’re not even doing it for the party, they’re doing it for this country -- because we suffered with Obamacare.  I went through two years of campaigning, and I’m telling you, no matter where I went, people were suffering so badly with the ravages of Obamacare.  And I will say this, that as far as I’m concerned, your premiums, they’re going to start to come down.  We’re going to get this passed through the Senate.  I feel so confident.  Your deductibles, when it comes to deductibles, they were so ridiculous that nobody got to use their current plan -- this nonexistent plan that I heard so many wonderful things about over the last three or four days.  After that, I mean, it’s -- I don’t think you’re going to hear so much.  Right now, the insurance companies are fleeing.  It’s been a catastrophe.  And this is a great plan.  I actually think it will get even better.  And this is, make no mistake, this is a repeal and replace of Obamacare.  Make no mistake about it.  Make no mistake.  (Applause.) And I think, most importantly, yes, premiums will be coming down.  Yes, deductibles will be coming down.  But very importantly, it’s a great plan.  And ultimately, that’s what it’s all about.  We knew that wasn’t going to work.  I predicted it a long time ago.  I said, it’s failing.  And now, it’s obvious that it’s failing.  It’s dead.  It’s essentially dead.  If we don’t pay lots of ransom money over to the insurance companies it would die immediately.  So what we have is something very, very incredibly well-crafted.  Tell you what, there is a lot of talent standing behind me.  An unbelievable amount of talent, that I can tell you.  I mean it.  (Applause.)  And coming from a different world and only being a politician for a short period of time -- how am I doing?  Am I doing okay?  I’m President.  Hey, I’m President.  Can you believe it?  Right?  (Applause.)  I don’t know, it’s -- I thought you needed a little bit more time.  They always told me, more time.  But we didn’t.But we have an amazing group of people standing behind me.  They worked so hard and they worked so long.  And when I said, let’s do this, let’s go out, just short little shots for each one of us and let’s say how good this plan is -- we don’t have to talk about this unbelievable victory -- wasn’t it unbelievable?  So we don’t have to say it again.  But it’s going to be an unbelievable victory, actually, when we get it through the Senate.  And there’s so much spirit there.  But I said, let’s go out -- we have a little list of some of the people -- and I think after that list goes, if they don’t talk too long, our first list, we’re going to let some of the other folks just come up and say whatever you want.But we want to brag about the plan, because this plan really -- uh oh.  (Laughter.)  Well, we may.  (Laughter.)  But we’re just going to talk a little bit about the plan, how good it is, some of the great features.  I want to thank Paul Ryan.  (Applause.)  He has worked so hard.  I was joking, I said, you know, Paul, for the last week I’ve been hearing “Paul Ryan doesn’t have it.  It’s not working with Paul Ryan.  He’s going to get rid of Paul Ryan.”  And then today I heard, “Paul Ryan is a genius, he’s come a long way.”  (Laughter.)  Right?SPEAKER RYAN:  I’ll take whatever.THE PRESIDENT:  The groups have all come together.  We have the Tuesday Group -- we have so many groups.  We have the Freedom Caucus.  We have -- and they’re all great people.  But we have a lot of groups.  But they all came together.  Really, Paul, I’d say in the last three, four days -- especially in the last day.  I see Mark and I see Kevin, I see so many people -- Jim. We just have developed a bond.  This has really brought the Republican Party together, as much as we’ve come up with a really incredible healthcare plan.  This has brought the Republican Party together.  We’re going to get this finished, and then we’re going -- as you know we put our tax plan in, it’s a massive tax cut, the biggest tax cut in the history of our country.  I used to say the biggest since Ronald Reagan.  Now, it’s bigger than that.  Also, pure tax reform.  So we’re going to get that done next.And this really helps it.  A lot of people said, how come you kept pushing healthcare, knowing how tough it is?  Don’t forget, Obamacare took 17 months.  Hillary Clinton tried so hard -- really valiantly, in all fairness, to get healthcare through.  Didn’t happen.  We’ve really been doing this for eight weeks, if you think about it.  And this is a real plan.  This is a great plan.  And we had no support from the other party.So I just want to introduce somebody to say a few words who really has been I think treated very unfairly, but it no longer matters because we won and we’re going to finish it off.  And we’re going to go on with a lot of other things, and we are going to have a tremendous four years and maybe, even more importantly, we’re going to have a tremendous eight years.  But we’re going to start off with just a great first year.And, Paul Ryan, come up and say a few wor
2017-05-03;https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/05/03/remarks-president-trump-school-choice-event;Remarks by President Trump at a School Choice Event;This is very exciting.  So yesterday I said that our spending bill was a win for the American people, which is exactly what it was -- an amazing day.  And this is what winning for young children and kids from all over the country looks like.  The opportunity scholarship program that we’re funding allows families in the inner city of our nation’s capital to leave failing public schools and attend a private school, making an extraordinary difference in these incredible young lives.  You’re so lucky.  (Laughter.)  Great.  You’re happy about it?  Huh?  (Applause.)  That’s great.The results speak for themselves.  Ninety-eight percent of scholarship recipients represent their high school diplomas, and they’re really very, very special.  They go into tremendous successes.  So I think you’re going to all be very, very successful.  You have a big start, right?  Great start.This is a beautiful event, and I’m thrilled to be here.  I congratulate the families in the audience.  Our families are very proud of the children.  Are you all proud of children, I hope?  (Applause.)  Anybody not proud?  We’re very proud of you.During my campaign for President, I promised to fight for school choice -- very important.  It was featured in my Joint Address to Congress.  And today, I’m calling on all lawmakers to work with us to help extend school choice to millions more children all across the United States of America, including millions of low-income Hispanic and African American children who deserve the same chance as every other child in America to live out their dreams and fill up their hearts and be educated at the top, top level.  (Applause.)Every child has the right to fulfill their potential, and, if we do our jobs, then we will never have to tell young, striving Americans to defer their dreams for another day or for another decade.  We’re not going to do that.  I’m honored to be here.  I’m so proud to be with these wonderful families and wonderful children.  And I’m deeply excited for the amazing things that lie ahead for these truly inspiring young Americans right here in Washington, D.C. -- our capital.And I will say that I’m very, very proud of all of you.  You know, I wasn’t supposed to be here.  It wasn’t on my schedule.  When I heard what was going on with Betsy, who’s doing such a great job, I said, well, I’ll come in and I’ll interrupt Betsy, and maybe I’ll be allowed to say a few words.  (Laughter.)  But she’s a great woman and doing a fantastic job.Congratulations to all of you and to your families.  Congratulations, e
2017-05-01;https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/05/01/remarks-president-trump-independent-community-bankers-association;Remarks by President Trump to the Independent Community Bankers Association;Wow, look at that.  Oh boy, oh boy.  They love Dodd-Frank, don’t they?  They love it.  (Laughter.)  Thank you very much.  I appreciate it.  Very nice.  Sit down, please.  Beautiful hats.  (Laughter.)Well, thanks, Mike Pence.  And Mike has been so great, and he’s on your side, believe me.  He’s on everybody’s side.  It’s a pleasure to welcome the community bankers to the White House today.  I want to, in particular, thank Cam Fine.  Cam Fine.  Stand up, Cam Fine.  Pretty well-known guy, too, huh?  (Applause.)  Congratulations, Cam, for leading the Independent Community Bankers of America.  And thank you for all being here today.  Very, very special.  It’s also a very special place, isn’t it?  When they say, how about coming to the White House, usually about 130 percent -- we try and find, who are the extras that are coming?  We always have to be careful.  But it’s a great place.I also want to thank our Small Business Administrator, Linda McMahon.  Where’s Linda?  Is she around someplace?  Linda McMahon.  Yes, thank you.  (Applause.)  Thanks, Linda, for joining us today.  She’s doing an incredible job helping small businesses just like you.  Some of you, I know you, you’re not that small.  I hate to tell you, you’re not small.  A lot of people would like to be small, right, Cam?  They’d like to be small like these small business people.  But they’re great people, employ a lot of people, and what they do through community development is amazing.Community banks are the backbone of small business in America.  Many of you are the reason that young families can purchase their first homes, farmers can buy their next tractor, and entrepreneurs can open up their first business, creating many, many new jobs in our country.  So true -- community banks.  Over half of the small business and loans going to small business -- and it’s really a substantial number higher than that -- come from their community banker.  You provide critical access to capital, especially for the rural communities.  That’s why, in the first 100 days, I have taken action to roll back burdensome regulations that undermine community banks, especially -- I know you’re going to be very disappointed at this -- Dodd-Frank, right?  (Applause.)  No, it’s out of control.  And by the way, not only for community banks -- for banks period.  We can take community out of that one, right?  Now, Dodd-Frank, we’re working on that right now and you’ll see a very big difference, because you want to get out and make our country work properly.I’ve directed my administration to provide regulatory reform and relief so that those rules don’t shut down community banks -- which have been shutting down -- and small businesses, and put them on a competitive disadvantage against the larger institutions.  That’s what it’s done.  It’s really made you and given you such a tremendous competitive disadvantage.  I have friends that are community bankers, and they’ve gone through hell over the last long period of time.  It’s really a much longer period of time than people would understand.I’ve also directed Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin to review damaging Dodd-Frank regulations that encourage risky behavior from Wall Street.  Everybody knows what that means.  We’re also working to achieve tax reform and dramatically lower taxes on businesses and the middle class.  We’re proposing one of the largest tax cuts in history, even larger than that of President Ronald Reagan.  Our tax cut is bigger.  (Applause.)My administration is committed to working with each and every one of you to help Americans achieve their financial dreams so that -- look, we’re all here for the same thing.  You know, we have a statement.  It’s really -- I like it much better than even your hat -- it says, make America great again, and that’s what we all want, right?  We want to all make it great again, and that’s what’s going to happen.  (Applause.)So, I want to thank you all for being here.  Very special people.  You do a very, very special job, and the community really understands it.  I know community bankers are the most popular person in their community, and they’ve built communities, and they’ve really been so badly hurt over the last number of years.  So we’re going to change that.  We’re going to change regulations.  We’re going to give the incentives back, and you’re going to grow and thrive and prosper.  And maybe even more importantly, you’re going to have businesses all over the country growing and thriving and prospering.  So I want to thank you for being here.  It’s a great honor.  And you will see things happening like you’ve ne
2017-04-29;https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/04/29/remarks-president-trump-signing-executive-orders-trade;Remarks by President Trump at Signing of Executive Orders on Trade;"Thank you, everybody, very much.  I appreciate you being here today.  Great people outside, you can see that.  These are great, great Americans and unbelievable workers.  Nobody has better than what we have.And it's wonderful to be at Ames -- an incredible company with a rich, rich history and a long history.  Centuries ago, before our country was even founded -- couldn’t believe that one -- this company produced the tools that helped to build our nation.  Later, Ames Tools would be used at the Statue of Liberty, the Empire State Building, the Hoover Dam, just to name a few of the monuments within our country.We believe in ""Made in the USA,"" and it's coming back stronger and better and faster than even I thought.  You can see that by our great, great workers throughout the plant, and plenty of other plants.  But for a long time, our government has sacrificed American companies and workers to unfair foreign competition.Today, I'm signing two orders to help keep jobs and wealth in our country.  First, in fulfillment of a very, very important and major campaign promise I made not far from here last June, I'm directing the Secretary of Commerce, who's with us -- Wilbur, where's Wilbur? --SECRETARY ROSS:  Right here, Mr. President. THE PRESIDENT:  -- Wilbur, a legend -- to identify every violation and abuse of our trade agreements, and to use every available measure under the law to end these abuses against our workers.  (Applause.)  And if they don’t get cleared up, Wilbur will end the trade agreements.  Do you agree with that?SECRETARY ROSS:  Yes, sir.THE PRESIDENT:  Second, I'm establishing the Office of Trade and Manufacturing Policy within the White House.  Its mission will be to defend American workers and companies from those who would steal our jobs and threaten our manufacturing base.  (Applause.)  Peter Navarro, one of the greats trying to protect our jobs.  Right, Peter?  Thank you, Peter.  Appreciate it.  We're only 100 days in.  It's been a lot of work, but we've loved it.  We've loved doing it.  You know, when you love something, it's really easy.  And we love it.  And we're helping people.  We're helping our workers.  And already we've created nearly 150,000 new manufacturing and construction jobs, and over 600,000 jobs have already been created.  The National Manufacturers survey found the highest level of optimism in the history of a very, very old survey.  It's been around for a long time.  It just last week hit the highest point it's ever hit in the history of the survey.  That means they're looking for action.  And we love that.We've taken unprecedented action to bring back American jobs, American wealth, and American dreams.  And we are just getting started.  So I want to thank Wilbur.  (Applause.)  So this is addressing trade agreement violations and abuses.  Very powerful.  They're shouting back there because they know exactly what I'm saying.  (Laughter.)  They know better than anybody else, believe me.(The executive order is signed.)And this is the establishment of the Office of Trade and Manufacturing Policy right out of the White House.  And it's going to have a huge impact on jobs.  (The executive order is signed.)Wilbur, with your permission, I think what I'm going to do is give this pen to Peter Navarro.  Is that okay?SECRETARY ROSS:  Sure.  Surely, sir.THE PRESIDENT:  Peter, come on over here.  (Applause.)  Peter Navarro has fought against trade abuse for a long time.  And, Peter, this is the first time you're seeing something happen -- all those decades you've been fighting.MR. NAVARRO:  It's been a great 100 days, and lots more to go.  THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Pete"

2017-04-28;https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/04/28/remarks-president-trump-signing-executive-order-america-first-offshore;Remarks by President Trump at Signing of Executive Order on an America-First Offshore Energy Strategy;Thank you, Mike Pence -- a really wonderful guy, and my great friend, and a truly great Vice President.  He will go down as a truly great Vice President.  Many thanks to Secretaries Wilbur Ross and Ryan Zinke.  Very proud of the job they're doing. We're also pleased to welcome many members of Congress and energy industry leaders to the White House.  And I want to get them immediately back over there because I know they're going to be voting on lots of different things, right?  So we can't spend too much time talking about drilling in the Arctic, right?  But we're opening it up.This is a great day for American workers and families, and today we're unleashing American energy and clearing the way for thousands and thousands of high-paying American energy jobs.  Our country is blessed with incredible natural resources, including abundant offshore oil and natural gas reserves.  But the federal government has kept 94 percent of these offshore areas closed for exploration and production.  And when they say closed, they mean closed.  This deprives our country of potentially thousands and thousands of jobs and billions of dollars in wealth.  I pledged to take action, and today I am keeping that promise.  This executive order starts the process of opening offshore areas to job-creating energy exploration.  It reverses the previous administration’s Arctic leasing ban.  So hear that:  It reverses the previous administration’s Arctic leasing ban, and directs Secretary Zinke to allow responsible development of offshore areas that will bring revenue to our Treasury and jobs to our workers.  (Applause.)  In addition, Secretary Zinke will be reconsidering burdensome regulations that slow job creation.  Finally, this order will enable better scientific study of our offshore resources and research that has blocked everything from happening for far too long.  You notice it doesn't get blocked for other nations.  It only gets blocked for our nation.Renewed offshore energy production will reduce the cost of energy, create countless good jobs, and make America more secure and far more energy independent.  This action is another historic step toward future development and future -- with a future -- a real future.  And I have to say that’s a real future with greater prosperity and security for all Americans, which is what we want.So I’m very proud of the people standing behind me.  I’m far less proud of the people standing in front of me.  (Laughter.)  The media.  But I have to tell you that this is a very important day, and I want to congratulate Wilbur and Ryan and all of the people that have worked so hard to get this put together so quickly.  And it’s going to lead to a lot of great wealth for our country and a lot of great jobs for our country. So God bless America.  Thank you very much.  (Applause.) (The executive order is signed.)Q    Mr. President, what's made this job harder than you thought?THE PRESIDENT:  We're moving awfully well.  We're getting a lot of things done.  I don’t think there's ever been anything like this.  It's a false standard, 100 days, but I have to tell you, I don’t think anybody has done what we did ove
2017-04-28;https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/04/28/remarks-president-trump-national-rifle-association-leadership-forum;Remarks by President Trump at the National Rifle Association Leadership Forum;", for that kind introduction and for your tremendous work on behalf of our Second Amendment.  Thank you very much.  (Applause.)  I want to also thank Wayne LaPierre for his unflinching leadership in the fight for freedom.  Wayne, thank you very much.  Great.  (Applause.)  I'd also like to congratulate Karen Handel on her incredible fight in Georgia 6.  (Applause.)  The election takes place on June 20th.  And, by the way, on primaries, let's not have 11 Republicans running for the same position, okay?  (Laughter.)  It's too nerve-shattering.  She's totally for the NRA and she's totally for the Second Amendment.  So get out and vote.  She's running against someone who's going to raise your taxes to the sky, destroy your healthcare, and he's for open borders -- lots of crime, and he's not even able to vote in the district that he's running in.  Other than that, I think he's doing a fantastic job, right?  (Laughter.)  So get out and vote for Karen.  Also, my friend -- he's become a friend, because there's nobody that does it like Lee Greenwood.  Wow.  (Applause.)  Lee’s anthem is the perfect description of the renewed spirit sweeping across our country.  And it really is, indeed, sweeping across our country.  So, Lee, I know I speak for everyone in this arena when I say, we are all very proud indeed to be an American.  Thank you very much, Lee.  (Applause.)  No one was more proud to be American than the beloved patriot -- and you know who I'm talking about -- we remember on gatherings like today, your former five-term President, the late Charlton Heston.  How good was Charlton?  (Applause.)  And I remember Charlton, he was out there fighting when maybe a lot of people didn’t want to be fighting.  He was out there for a long time.  He was a great guy.  And it's truly wonderful to be back in Atlanta, and back with my friends at the NRA.  You are my friends, believe me.  (Applause.)  Perhaps some of you remember the last time we were all together.  Remember that?  We had a big crowd then, too.  So we knew something was happening.  But it was in the middle of a historic political year, and in the middle of a truly historic election.  What fun that was -- November 8.  Wasn’t that a great evening?  Do you remember that evening?  (Applause.)  Remember that?  (Applause.)  Remember they were saying, ""We have breaking news: Donald Trump has won the state of Michigan.""  They go, ""Michigan?  How did that"" -- ""Donald Trump has won the state of Wisconsin, whoa.""  But earlier in the evening, remember, Florida, North Carolina, South Carolina, Pennsylvania, all the way up -- we ran up the East Coast.  And, you know, the Republicans have a tremendous disadvantage in the Electoral College, you know that.  Tremendous disadvantage.  And to run the whole East Coast, and then you go with Iowa and Ohio, and all of the different states.  It was a great evening, one that a lot people will never forget -- a lot of people.  (Applause.)  Not going to forget that evening.  And remember they said, “There is no path to 270.”  For months I was hearing that.  You know, they’re trying to suppress the vote.  So they keep saying it, so people say, you know, I really like Trump, he loves the Second Amendment, he loves the NRA; I love him, but let’s go to the movie because he can’t win.  Because they’re trying to suppress the vote.But they’d say -- I mean, hundreds of times I heard, there is no -- there’s no route.  They’d say it, “There is no route to 270.”  And we ended up with 306.  So they were right:  Not 270, 306.  (Applause.)  That was some evening.  Big sports fans said that was the single-most exciting event they’ve ever seen.  That includes Super Bowls and World Series and boxing matches.  That was an exciting evening for all of us, and it meant a lot.Only one candidate in the General Election came to speak to you, and that candidate is now the President of the United States, standing before you again.  (Applause.)  I have a feeling that in the next election you’re going to be swamped with candidates, but you’re not going to be wasting your time.  You’ll have plenty of those Democrats coming over and you’re going to say, no, sir, no thank you -- no, ma’am.  Perhaps ma’am.  It may be Pocahontas, remember that.  (Laughter and applause.)  And she is not big for the NRA, that I can tell you.  But you came through for me, and I am going to come through for you.  (Applause.)  I was proud to receive the NRA’s earliest endorsement in the history of the organization.  And today, I am also proud to be the first sitting President to address the NRA Leadership Forum since our wonderful Ronald Reagan in 1983.  (Applause.)  And I want to thank each and every one of you not only for your help electing true friends of the Second Amendment, but for everything you do to defend our flag and our freedom.With your activism, you helped to safeguard the freedoms of our soldiers who have bled and died for us on the battlefields.  And I know we have many veterans in the audience today, and we want to give them a big, big beautiful round of applause.  (Applause.)  And, like I promised, we are doing a really top job already -- 99 days -- but already with the Veterans Administration, people are seeing a big difference.  We are working really hard at the VA, and you’re going to see it, and you’re already seeing it.  And it’s my honor.  I’ve been telling you we’re going to do it, and we’re doing it.  (Applause.)  Thank you.   The NRA protects in our capitols and legislative houses the freedoms that our servicemembers have won for us on those incredible battlefields.  And it’s been a tough fight against those who would go so far as to ban private gun ownership entirely.   But I am here to deliver you good news.  And I can tell you that Wayne and Chris have been fighting with me long and hard to make sure that we were with you today, not somebody else with an empty podium.  Because believe me, the podium would have been empty.  They fought long and hard, and I think you folks cannot thank them enough.  They were with us all the way, right from the beginning.  (Applause.)  But we have news that you’ve been waiting for for a long time:  The eight-year assault on your Second Amendment freedoms has come to a crashing end.  (Applause.)  You have a true friend and champion in the White House.  No longer will federal agencies be coming after law-abiding gun owners.  (Applause.)  No longer will the government be trying to undermine your rights and your freedoms as Americans.  Instead, we will work with you, by your side.  We will work with the NRA to promote responsible gun ownership, to protect our wonderful hunters and their access to the very beautiful outdoors.  You met my son -- I can tell you, both sons, they love the outdoors.  Frankly, I think they love the outdoors more than they love, by a long shot, Fifth Avenue.  But that’s okay.  And we want to ensure you of the sacred right of self-defense for all of our citizens.  (Applause.)  When I spoke to this forum last year, our nation was still mourning the loss of a giant, a great defender of the Constitution:  Justice Antonin Scalia.  (Applause.)  I promised that if elected, I would nominate a justice who would be faithful and loyal to the Constitution.  I even went one step further and publicly presented a list of 20 judges from which I would make my selection, and that’s exactly what we did. And, by the way, I want to thank, really, Heritage.  And I want to thank also all of the people that worked with us.  Where’s Leo?  Is Leo around here?  Where is he?  He’s got to be here.  Where is he?  He has been so good.  And also from Heritage, Jim DeMint.  It’s been amazing.  I mean, those people have been fantastic.  They’ve been real friends.  (Applause.)  The Federalist people -- where are they?  Are they around here someplace?  They really helped us out.  I kept my promise, and now, with your help, our brand-new Justice -- and he is really something very special -- Neil Gorsuch, sits on the bench of the United States Supreme Court.  (Applause.)  For the first time in the modern political era, we have confirmed a new justice in the first 100 days.  (Applause.)  The last time that happened was 136 years ago, in 1881.  Now, we won’t get any credit for this, but don’t worry about it, the credit is in the audience, right?  The credit is in the audience.  (Applause.)  All of those people.  They won’t give us credit, but it’s been a long time, and we’re very honored.We’ve also taken action to stand up for America’s sportsmen.  On their very last full day in office, the previous administration issued an 11th-hour rule to restrict the use of lead ammunition on certain federal lands.  Have you heard about that, folks?  I’m shocked to hear that.  You’ve all heard about that.  You’ve heard about that.  On his first day as Secretary of the Interior, Ryan Zinke eliminated the previous administration’s ammunition ban.  (Applause.)  He’s going to be great.  Ryan is going to be great. We’ve also moved very quickly to restore something gun owners care about very, very much.  It’s called the rule of law.  (Applause.)  We have made clear that our administration will always stand with the incredible men and women of law enforcement.  (Applause.)  In fact, countless members of law enforcement are also members of the NRA, because our police know that responsible gun ownership saves lives, and that the right of self-defense is essential to public safety.  Do we all agree with that?  (Applause.)  Our police and sheriffs also know that when you ban guns, only the criminals will be armed.  (Applause.)  For too long, Washington has gone after law-abiding gun owners while making life easier for criminals, drug dealers, traffickers and gang members.  MS-13 -- you know about MS-13?  It’s not pleasant for them anymore, folks.  It’s not pleasant for them anymore.  That’s a bad group.  (Applause.)  Not pleasant for MS-13.  Get them the hell out of here, right?  Get them out.  (Applause.) We are protecting the freedoms of law-abiding Americans, and we are going after the criminal gangs and cartels that prey on our innocent citizens.  And we are really going after them.  (Applause.) As members of the NRA know well, some of the most important decisions a President can make are appointments -- and I’ve appointed people who believe in law, order, and justice.  (Applause.) That is why I have selected as your Attorney General, number one, a really fine person, a really good man, a man who has spent his career fighting crime, supporting the police, and defending the Second Amendment.  For the first time in a long time, you now have a pro-Second-Amendment, tough-on-crime Attorney General, and his name is Jeff Sessions.  (Applause.) And Attorney General Sessions is putting our priorities into action.  He’s going after the drug dealers who are peddling their poison all over our streets and destroying our youth.  He’s going after the gang members who threaten our children.  And he’s fully enforcing our immigration laws in all 50 states.  And you know what?  It’s about time.  (Applause.) Heading up the effort to secure America’s borders is a great military general, a man of action:  Homeland Security Director [sic], John Kelly.  (Applause.) Secretary Kelly, who used to be General Kelly, is following through on my pledge to protect the borders, remove criminal aliens, and stop the drugs from pouring into our country.  We’ve already seen -- listen to this; it never happened before, people can't even believe it.  And, by the way, we will build the wall no matter how low this number gets or how this goes.  Don't even think about it.  Don't even think about it.  (Applause.) You know, they're trying to use this number against us because we've done so unbelievably at the borders already.  They're trying to use it against us.  But you need that wall to stop the human trafficking, to stop the drugs, to stop the wrong people.  You need the wall.  But listen to this:  We've already seen a 73 percent decrease -- never happened before -- in illegal immigration on the southern border since my election -- 73 percent.  (Applause.) You see what they're doing, right?  So why do you need a wall?  We need a wall.AUDIENCE MEMBER:  Build the wall!THE PRESIDENT:  We’ll build the wall.  Don't even think about it.  Don't even think about it.  Don't even think about it.  That's an easy one.  We're going to build the wall.  We need the wall.I said to General Kelly, how important is it?  He said, very important.  It’s that final element.  We need the wall.  And it’s a wall in certain areas.  Obviously, where you have these massive physical structures you don't need, and we have certain big rivers and all.  But we need a wall, and we're going to get that wall.  (Applause.) And the world is getting the message.  They know that our border is no longer open to illegal immigration, and that if you try to break in, you’ll be caught and you’ll be returned to your home.  You're not staying any longer.  And if you keep coming back illegally after deportation, you will be arrested, prosecuted, and you will put behind bars.  Otherwise it will never end.  (Applause.) Let’s also remember that immigration security is national security.  We’ve seen the attacks from 9/11 to Boston to San Bernardino.  Hundreds of individuals from other countries have been charged with terrorism-related offenses in the United States.We spend billions and billions of dollars on security all over the world, but then we allow radical Islamic terrorists to enter right through our front door.  That's not going to happen anymore.  (Applause.)  It’s time to get tough.  It’s time we finally got smart.  And yes, it’s also time to put America first.  (Applause.) And perhaps -- I see all of those beautiful red and white hats --- but we will never forget our favorite slogan of them all:  Make America Great Again.  All right?  (Applause.) Keeping our communities safe and protecting our freedoms also requires the cooperation of our state leaders.  We have some incredible pro-Second Amendment governors here at the NRA conference, including Governor Scott of Florida.  Where is Governor Scott?  Great guy doing a great job.  Governor Bryant of Mississippi.  What a wonderful place.  Governor Bryant is here.  Thank you.  Governor Deal of Georgia.  (Applause.)  And we're also joined by two people that -- well, one I loved right from the beginning; the other one I really liked, didn't like, and now like a lot again.  (Laughter.)  Does that make sense?  Senator David Perdue -- he was from the beginning -- and Senator Ted Cruz -- like, dislike, like.  (Applause.)  Where are they?  Good guys.  Good guys.  Smart cookies.Each of these leaders knows that public officials must serve under the Constitution, not above it.  We all took an oath to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States -- and that means defending the Second Amendment.  (Applause.) So let me make a simple promise to every one of the freedom-loving Americans in the audience today:  As your President, I will never, ever infringe on the right of the people to keep and bear arms.  Never ever.  (Applause.)  Freedom is not a gift from government.  Freedom is a gift from God.  (Applause.) It was this conviction that stirred the heart of a great American patriot on that day, April, 242 years ago. It was the day that Paul Revere spread his Lexington alarm -- the famous warning that ""the British are coming, the British are coming."" Right?  You've all heard that, right?  The British are coming.Now we have other people trying to come, but believe me, they're not going to be successful.  That I can tell you.  (Applause.)  Nothing changes, right, folks?  Nothing changes.  They are not going to be successful.  There will be serious hurt on them, not on us.  Next, came the shot heard around the world, and then a rag-tag army of God-fearing farmers, frontiersmen, shopkeepers, merchants that stood up to the most powerful army at that time on Earth.  The most powerful army on Earth.  But we sometimes forget what inspired those everyday farmers and workers in that great war for independence.  Many years after the war, a young man asked Captain Levi Preston, aged 91, why he’d fought alongside his neighbors at Concord.  Was it the Stamp Act?  Was it the Tea Tax?  Was it a work of philosophy?  ""No,"" the old veteran replied. “Then why?” he was asked.  “Young man,” the Captain said, “what we meant in going for those Redcoats was this:  We always had governed ourselves, and we always meant to"" govern ourselves.  (Applause.)  Captain Preston’s words are a reminder of what this organization and my administration are all about:  the right of a sovereign people to govern their own affairs, and govern them properly.  (Applause.)  We don’t want any longer to be ruled by the bureaucrats in Washington, or in any other country for that matter.  In America, we are ruled by our citizens.  We are ruled by each and every one of you.But we can’t be complacent.  These are dangerous times.  These are horrible times for certain obvious reasons.  But we’re going to make them great times again.  Every day, we are up against those who would take away our freedoms, restrict our liberties, and even those who want to abolish the Second Amendment.  We must be vigilant.  And I know you are all up to the task.Since the first generation of Americans stood strong at Concord, each generation to follow has answered the call to defend freedom in their time.  That is why we are here today:  To defend freedom for our children.  To defend the liberty of all Americans.  And to defend the right of a free and sovereign people to keep and bear arms.I greatly appreciated your support on November 8th, in what will hopefully be one of the most important and positive elections for the United States of all time.  And to the NRA, I can proudly say I will never, ever let you down.Thank you.  God Bless you.  God Bless our Constitution, and God bless America.  Thank you very much. "

And it's a great, great honor to have them here.  He's been my friend for many years.  We've known each other for long, prior to politics.  And who would have thought this was going to happen --PRESIDENT MACRI:  Nobody.PRESIDENT TRUMP:  -- for both of us.  But he is a great, wonderful person, and he will be a great President of Argentina, I have absolutely no doubt.  Absolutely no doubt.Q    Mr. Trump, what do you want to achieve with our country, with Argentina?PRESIDENT TRUMP:  We're just going to be great friends, better than ever before.  And we're off to a wonderful start, because I've known Mauricio for so many years, and I know the kind of person he is.  He's a great person and he's a great leader.  He will do a fantastic job for Argentina.  And I feel very comfortable backing him, because they need certain things from the United States.  I feel very comfortable backing him because I know what I'm backing.  I'm backing a man who loves his people and loves his country.Q    If he's such a good President, Mr. President, are you going to let the lemons -- the Argentine lemons in, in your country?  They are very good.  People will love you if you let them in.PRESIDENT TRUMP:  I know about all the lemons.  And believe it or not, the lemon business is a big, big business.Q    Just say yes!  (Laughter.)  PRESIDENT TRUMP:  But we are going to give that very serious consideration.  One of the reasons he's here is about lemons -- (laughter) -- and I'll tell him about North Korea, and he'll tell me about lemons.  I think that we're going to be very favorably disposed.  We're going to be talking.Q    What do you think about Venezuela, Mr. President?THE PRESIDENT:  Venezuela is a mess.  Venezuela is a mess.Q    Mr. President, on renegotiating NAFTA, tell me how you came about the decision --PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Well, I was going to terminate NAFTA as of two or three days from now.  The President of Mexico, who I have a very, very good relationship, called me, and also the Prime Minister of Canada, who I have a very good relationship.  And I like both of these gentlemen very much.  They called me and they said, rather than terminating NAFTA, could you please renegotiate?  I like them very much.  I respect their countries very much.  The relationship is very special.  And I said, I will hold on the termination; let's see if we can make it a fair deal.  Because NAFTA has been a horrible deal for the United States.  It's been very good for Canada, it's been very good for Mexico, but it's been horrible for the United States.  And if you check my campaign -- any of my speeches -- I said, I'll either renegotiate or I'll terminate.  So they asked me to renegotiate -- I will.  And I think we'll be successful in the renegotiation, which, frankly, would be good because it would be simpler.  But we have to make a deal that's fair for the United States.  They understand that.  And so I decided rather than terminating NAFTA, which would be a pretty big shock to the system, we will renegotiate.  Now, if I'm unable to make a fair deal, if I'm unable to make a fair deal for the United States, meaning a fair deal for our workers and our companies, I will terminate NAFTA.  But we're going to give renegotiation a good, strong shot.Thank you very much, everybody.  Thank you very much.Q    What about Venezuela, Mr. President?  Mr. President, about Venezuela, what is your position?PRESIDENT TRUMP:  I'm very sad for Venezuela.  I'm very sad to see what's happen"

Busy, busy day.  These are great people.  We’re with great people right now.So I want to thank you.  It’s my pleasure to welcome so many extraordinary teachers to the White House.  This is called the people’s house.  I also want to congratulate the Council of Chief State School Officers on their 65th year recognizing America’s outstanding teachers.  These are the greatest there are -- nobody better.  So I want to congratulate you all.  It’s amazing.Each of you has dedicated yourself to inspiring young minds and to putting our children on a path to happiness and success -- lots of success.  There are 55 Teachers of the Year who are here with us from every state -- every state in the union, is that right?  Every single state.So let’s see, who’s from Alabama?  Great state.PARTICIPANT:  We would love for you to come and visit us.  (Laughter.) PARTICIPANT:  He’s coming to Maryland.  It’s right next door.THE PRESIDENT:  Who’s from Indiana?  Oh, wow, that’s fantastic.  We have our Vice President.  We have Karen Pence.  So thank you very much.Today, we honor one teacher in particular.  She is the 2017 National Teacher of the Year, Sydney Chaffee.  (Applause.)  Sydney is a ninth grade humanities teacher at Codman Academy Charter School in Dorchester, Massachusetts -- nice place, by the way.  Sydney is the first teacher from Massachusetts ever to win the award, and the first from a public charter school.  That is really something special.Sydney, I would like to congratulate you on this tremendous achievement.  There is nothing more important than being a teacher, and certainly for being a great teacher.  You’re all great, great teachers, and congratulations to all.  (Applause.) When you go home, I hope you all say that your trip to the White House was something very special.  I know Melania has been working with you now for quite a while.  She is a tremendous fan of wonderful teachers.  But she’s worked very hard and we’re having some special times here.  This is Melania’s birthday and you were very nice to sing happy birthday, even though we’re celebrating you.So thank you all very much and God bless you all.  And you go back and keep teaching those students because, like I said -- oh, look, and you’re crying --PARTICIPANT:  Sorry, I’m always crying!  (Laughter.) THE PRESIDENT:  I know, the Oval Office can do that.  I have had some of the biggest executives in the world and they’ve been here many times.  I said, have you ever been to the Oval Office, and they said no.  I mean, I once had here like the biggest, from the biggest companies.  And they walk into the Oval Office and they start crying.  I said, I promise I won’t say to your various stockholders that you cried.  (Laughter.)   But I have seen people cry that you’d never believe.  It’s a very special place, and it’s a speci
2017-04-26;https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/04/26/remarks-president-trump-signing-executive-order-federalism-education;Remarks by President Trump at Signing of Executive Order on Federalism Education;NT:  Well, good afternoon.  It’s my great honor, on behalf of the President and the First Lady, to welcome you all to the White House.  This is a distinguished group of American leaders, governors and members of Congress, and members of our Cabinet, and we’re grateful to have you all here. You know, for nearly 100 days, President Trump has been delivering on the promises that he made to the American people.  The President has been fighting for American jobs every single day since he was elected, putting renewed emphasis on American energy, cutting through a mountain range of red tape from the last administration.  And today, the administration outlined the President’s vision for tax reform which will include one of the largest tax cuts for individuals and businesses in the history of this country.  (Applause.) Thanks to the President Trump’s leadership, more than 500,000 jobs have been created in 2017 alone.  Businesses and consumers are more confident than they have been in years, and by some measure, for decades.  It is truly extraordinary.In a word, President Trump has simply been in the promise-keeping business since Inauguration Day.  He signed 28 bills into law, the most of any President since 1947, and he’ll have signed some 30 executive orders in his first 100 days, including the action today.And today the President is actually delivering on one more of his promises to the American people.  Since day one, President Trump has been working tirelessly to uphold the Constitution and restore the proper balance between the states and the federal government.  And that’s been especially true with the President’s focus on education.  Now as a former governor myself, I’ve always believed, as the President does, that education is a state and local function, and that decisions in education are best made by parents and teachers and local administrators.  The decisions over our children’s school should be made by parents and local administrators, not by politicians or unelected bureaucrats in a far, distant capital.The President believes the same thing, and the efforts that he will take today through this executive order will continue that process of empowering our families, empowering our states to ensure that every child in America has access to a world-class education.And so with a grateful heart, I say, on behalf of the 45th President of the United States and on behalf of all those gathered here today, it is my high honor and distinct privilege to introduce to you the President of the United States, President Donald Trump.  (Applause.) THE PRESIDENT:  Well, thank you very much, Vice President Pence, who has done an absolutely outstanding job as Vice President.  We very much appreciate it.  And I want to thank also Education Secretary Betsy DeVos for spearheading out effort to restore state and local control of our schools.  Thank you very much, Betsy.  With her help, we are empowering those who know our students best -- I would say, by far, the best, right, Betsy? -- their parents and the teachers, so that every child has the chance to succeed. In fact, we’re proud to have some of those wonderful teachers here with us today, and we’d like to welcome all of them to the White House.  It’s a great honor.  (Applause.)  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you very much. I also want to thank members of Congress, local leaders, and governors for joining us here today, including Governor Ivey of Alabama, a new and great governor.  You will be fantastic.  I’ve been hearing about you for years in the positive way, so I’m not surprised that you’re governor of Alabama.  Congratulations.  Tremendous.Governor Branstad, who is soon going to be heading out, I suspect, to a place called China.  They love him, I will tell you.  They really love the soon-to-be ambassador, but he also loves China.  So it was a good combination.  I was very happy to put it together.  They’re looking forward to seeing you.  Very much so.  Thank you.  Thank you, Governor.  (Applause.) Governor LePage of Maine, Governor Sandoval of Nevada, Governor Herbert of Utah, Governor Mead of Wyoming -- we want to thank you all and everyone else for being with us.  It’s really an honor to have you in White House.For too long, the federal government has imposed its will on state and local governments.  The result has been education that spends more and achieves far, far, far less.  My administration has been working to reverse this federal power grab and give power back to families, cities, states.  Give power back to localities.Before this administration, only one time in our nation’s history had a President signed a bill that used the Congressional Review Act to cancel a federal regulation.  In less than 100 days, I have signed 13 bills such congressional resolutions to cancel federal regulations and give power back to the people, and I’m very honored to have done so.  (Applause.)  That’s true.  As you said, five have come from your committee, that’s exactly right.  Good job.  I think she’s done a good job.  (Applause.) I’ve also signed over a dozen executive actions that reverse federal intrusion and empower local communities.  The executive order I’m signing today is another critical step to restoring local control, which is so important.  This executive order directs Secretary DeVos to review current federal regulations and ensure that they don’t obstruct the ability of states, local governments, teachers, and most importantly, parents, to make the best decisions for their students and, in many cases, for their children.Previous administrations have wrongfully forced states and schools to comply with federal whims and dictate what our kids are taught.  But we know that local communities do it best and know it best.  The time has come to empower parents and teachers to make the decisions that help their students achieve success.  That’s what this executive order is all about.  So important.Thomas Jefferson put it best when he said, “I believe the states can best govern our home concerns.”  With this executive order and the many actions we have taken in less than 100 days, we are providing our states and communities with control over the matters that are most important to them.  Together we are going to fight to give our children the bright and beautiful future they deserve.  (Applause.) So I want to thank you all.  As you know, I’m heading over to a Senate meeting.  It’s a very important meeting.  So I’ll be leaving now, but I just wanted to introduce our really exceptional Education Secretary.  She’s caught on -- you wouldn’t believe it, all of the great things I’m hearing about you, Betsy.  I’m very proud.  So, Secretary Betsy DeVos.  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  (Applause.) Q    Mr. President, would you want to see a healthcare vote by the end of this week?  Would you like to see that, sir?THE PRESIDENT:  Always.SECRETARY DEVOS:  So it has been all of our experience, that those closest to the problem are best equipped to solve it.  That means empowering parents, teachers, state and local leaders -- not the federal government.  Time and time again, we’ve seen that one-size-fits-all policies and mandates from Washington simply don’t work.  We can’t have a cookie-cutter approach to education.  Each state and each school have different challenges, and each individual student has unique needs.  Our solutions should be as varied as the students we serve.  The Every Student Succeeds Act was a good step in this direction, giving flexibility to states to best meet the needs of their communities.  We’re going to implement this law as Congress intended, not how the previous administration dictated.  When we give decision-making power back to states and communities, students benefit.  This executive order puts us on that track.So I thank the President for signing this executive order, and for his commitment to an education policy that puts students first.  It’s my honor now to introduce the governor of the great state of Nevada, Brian Sandoval.  (Applause.) GOVERNOR SANDOVAL:  Thank you Madam Secretary and Mr. President.THE PRESIDENT:  Oh, it’s going to be a short speech because I -- I just felt I had to stay here.  (Laughter.) GOVERNOR SANDOVAL:  It just got shorter, Mr. President.  (Laughter.) Mr. Vice President, members of Congress, my fellow governors, representatives, teachers, educators, it really is a privilege and honor to be with you all today.  You know, in my home state of Nevada, I often say that what happens in our schools today will determine the future of our great state.  And Mr. President, I know that your action today will empower every state to improve our delivery of education.  Most importantly, it will allow governors across the nation to ensure that all states serve all students from all backgrounds.Now, as the incoming chair of the National Governors Association, I know that the governors will collectively continue to act as the national voice on federalism.  And as the leaders of education in our states, we look forward to working with this administration to ensure our role is reflected in federal policy.Now, over time, the Department of Education’s obligations have grown beyond its initial charge, and many well-intended act resulted in states feeling more and more constrained by federal rules.  Today, Mr. President, you’re signing of this executive order will place the states back in the driver’s seat.  Thank you, sir.  (Applause.) So, Mr. President, again, I’m going skip a page -- (Laughter.) THE PRESIDENT:  Education for North Korea.  (Laughter.) I like education. GOVERNOR SANDOVAL:  This is even better than I hoped for, Mr. President.  The Every Student Succeeds Act embodies the vision you have for education and the limited role of the federal government.Mr. President, you have changed the game for the better in the United States, and for that I thank you for your leadership.  (Applause.)THE PRESIDENT:  This is a good one, right -- on federal control of education.  Doesn’t get better than that, right?(The President signs the executive order.)Q    Mr. President, can you say to the American people that your tax plan will not blow a hole in the deficit? THE PRES
2017-04-26;https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/04/26/remarks-president-trump-signing-executive-order-antiquities-act;Remarks by President Trump at Signing of Executive Order on the Antiquities Act;Thank you, Mike.  He’s been a great Vice President, a great help.  And everybody loves Mike Pence.  I just want to thank you for your service.  Been incredible.  (Applause.) It’s a real pleasure to be at the Department of Interior, where you help preserve the splendor and the beauty of America’s natural resources.  And I can tell you the group that's in here right now, they really do the job.  Right, Lisa?  They’re doing a good job.  We're going to take care of Alaska, too.  Don't worry about it.  (Laughter.)  And they protect the ability of the people to access and utilize the land which truly belongs to them and belongs to all of us.Secretary Ryan Zinke is doing an incredible job -- and he never overlooks the details.  He’s a detail person.  Soon after he was confirmed, we had a snowstorm, big one, and he was out there on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial shoveling the snow all by himself.  And he’s a strong guy.  He did a good job.  (Laughter.)  He did a very, very good job.  But we're proud of him.In the first 100 days, we have taken historic action to eliminate wasteful regulations.  They're being eliminated like nobody has ever seen before.  There has never been anything like it.  Sometimes I look at some of the things I’m signing I say maybe people won’t like it, but I’m doing the right thing.  And no regular politician is going do it.  (Laughter.)  I don't know if you folks would do -- I will tell you literally some politicians have said, you're doing the right thing.  I don't know if I would have had the courage to do some of these things.  But we're doing them because it’s the right thing to do.  And it’s for the good of the nation.We're returning power back to the people.  We’ve eliminated job-destroying regulations on farmers, ranchers, and coal miners, on autoworkers, and so many other American workers and businesses.Today, I am signing a new executive order to end another egregious abuse of federal power, and to give that power back to the states and to the people, where it belongs.The previous administration used a 100-year-old law known as the Antiquities Act to unilaterally put millions of acres of land and water under strict federal control -- have you heard about that? -- eliminating the ability of the people who actually live in those states to decide how best to use that land. Today, we are putting the states back in charge.  It’s a big thing.I am pleased to be joined by so many members of Congress and governors who have been waiting for this moment, including Governor Herbert of Utah.  Thank you, thank you, Governor.  Governor LePage of Maine, who, by the way, has lost a lot of weight.  (Laughter.)  I knew him when he was heavy, and now I know him when he’s thin, and I like him both ways, okay?  (Laughter.)  Done a great job.  Governor Calvo of Guam.  Thank you.  Governor Torres from the Northern Mariana Islands.  Thank you, thank you, Governor.I also want to recognize Senator Orrin Hatch, who -- believe me, he’s tough.  He would call me and call me and say, you got to do this.  Is that right, Orrin?SENATOR HATCH:  That's right.  THE PRESIDENT:  You didn't stop.  He doesn't give up.  And he’s shocked that I’m doing it, but I’m doing it because it’s the right thing to do.  But I really have to point you out, you didn't stop.  And, Mike, the same thing.  So many people feel -- Mike Lee -- so many people feel so strongly about this, and so I appreciate your support and your prodding, and your never-ending prodding, I should say, because we're now getting something done that many people thought would never ever get done, and I’m very proud to be doing it in honor of you guys, okay?  Thank you.  (Applause.)  Altogether, the previous administration bypassed the states to place over 265 million acres -- that's a lot of land, million acres.  Think of it -- 265 million acres of land and water under federal control through the abuse of the monuments designation.  That’s larger than the entire state of Texas.In December of last year alone, the federal government asserted this power over 1.35 million acres of land in Utah, known as Bears Ears -- I’ve heard a lot about Bears Ears, and I hear it’s beautiful -- over the profound objections of the citizens of Utah.  The Antiquities Act does not give the federal government unlimited power to lock up millions of acres of land and water, and it’s time we ended this abusive practice. I’ve spoken with many state and local leaders -- a number of them here today -- who care very much about preserving our land, and who are gravely concerned about this massive federal land grab.  And it’s gotten worse and worse and worse, and now we're going to free it up, which is what should have happened in the first place.  This should never have happened.   That’s why today I am signing this order and directing Secretary Zinke to end these abuses and return control to the people -- the people of Utah, the people of all of the states, the people of the United States. Every day, we are going to continue pushing ahead with our reform agenda to put the American people back in charge of their government and their lives.  And again, I want to congratulate the Secretary.  I want to congratulate Orrin and Mike and all of the people that worked so hard on bringing it to this point.  And tremendously positive things are going to happen on that incredible land, the likes of which there is nothing more beautiful anywhere in the world.  But now tremendously positive things will happen.So I want to thank you.  I want to thank everybody for being here.  God bless you all and God bless America.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  So I’ll sign.(The executive order is signed.)  (Applause.) Q    Are you surprised about this 9th Circuit ruling?THE PRESIDENT:  I’m never surprised by the 9th Circuit.  (Laughter.)  As I said, we’ll see t
2017-04-25;https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/04/25/remarks-president-trump-united-states-holocaust-memorial-museum-national;Remarks by President Trump at United States Holocaust Memorial Museum National Days of Remembrance ;Thank you very much.  Thank you.  Friends, members of Congress, ambassadors, veterans, and, most especially, to the survivors here with us today, it’s an honor to join you on this very, very solemn occasion.  I am deeply moved to stand before those who survived history’s darkest hour.  Your cherished presence transforms this place into a sacred gathering.Thank you, Tom Bernstein, Alan Holt, Sara Bloomfield, and everyone at the Holocaust Memorial Council and Museum for your vital work and tireless contributions.We are privileged to be joined by Israel’s Ambassador to the United States, friend of mine -- he’s done a great job and said some wonderful words -- Ron Dermer.  The State of Israel is an eternal monument to the undying strength of the Jewish people.  The fervent dream that burned in the hearts of the oppressed is now filled with the breath of life, and the Star of David waves atop a great nation arisen from the desert.To those in the audience who have served America in uniform, our country eternally thanks you.  We are proud and grateful to be joined today by veterans of the Second World War who liberated survivors from the camps.  Your sacrifice helped save freedom for the world -- for the entire world.  (Applause.)   Sadly, this year marks the first Day of Remembrance since the passing of Elie Wiesel, a great person, a great man.  His absence leaves an empty space in our hearts, but his spirit fills this room.  It is the kind of gentle spirit of an angel who lived through hell, and whose courage still lights the path from darkness.  Though Elie’s story is well known by so many people, it’s always worth repeating.  He suffered the unthinkable horrors of the Holocaust.  His mother and sister perished in Auschwitz.  He watched his father slowly dying before his own young eyes in Buchenwald.  He lived through an endless nightmare of murder and death, and he inscribed on our collective conscience the duty we have to remember that long, dark night so as never to again repeat it. The survivors in this hall, through their testimony, fulfill the righteous duty to never forget, and engrave into the world’s memory the Nazi genocide of the Jewish people.  You witnessed evil, and what you saw is beyond description, beyond any description.  Many of you lost your entire family, everything and everyone you loved, gone.  You saw mothers and children led to mass slaughter.  You saw the starvation and the torture.  You saw the organized attempt at the extermination of an entire people -- and great people, I must add.  You survived the ghettos, the concentration camps and the death camps.  And you persevered to tell your stories.  You tell of these living nightmares because, despite your great pain, you believe in Elie’s famous plea, that “For the dead and the living, we must bear witness.”  That is why we are here today -- to remember and to bear witness.  To make sure that humanity never, ever forgets.The Nazis massacred 6 million Jews.  Two out of every three Jews in Europe were murdered in the genocide.  Millions more innocent people were imprisoned and executed by the Nazis without mercy, without even a sign of mercy.  Yet, even today, there are those who want to forget the past.  Worse still, there are even those filled with such hate, total hate, that they want to erase the Holocaust from history.  Those who deny the Holocaust are an accomplice to this horrible evil.  And we’ll never be silent -- we just won’t -- we will never, ever be silent in the face of evil again.  (Applause.)  Denying the Holocaust is only one of many forms of dangerous anti-Semitism that continues all around the world.  We’ve seen anti-Semitism on university campuses, in the public square, and in threats against Jewish citizens.  Even worse, it’s been on display in the most sinister manner when terrorists attack Jewish communities, or when aggressors threaten Israel with total and complete destruction.This is my pledge to you:  We will confront anti-Semitism (Applause.)  We will stamp out prejudice.  We will condemn hatred.  We will bear witness.  And we will act.  As President of the United States, I will always stand with the Jewish people -- and I will always stand with our great friend and partner, the State of Israel.So today, we remember the 6 million Jewish men, women and children whose lives and dreams were stolen from this Earth.We remember the millions of other innocent victims the Nazis so brutally targeted and so brutally killed.  We remember the survivors who bore more than we can imagine.  We remember the hatred and evil that sought to extinguish human life, dignity, and freedom.  But we also remember the light that shone through the darkness.  We remember sisters and brothers who gave everything to those they loved -- survivors like Steven Springfield, who, in the long death march, carried his brother on his back.  As he said, “I just couldn’t give in.” We remember the brave souls who banded together to save the lives of their neighbors -- even at the risk of their own life.  And we remember those first hopeful moments of liberation, when at long last the American soldiers arrived in camps and cities throughout occupied Europe, waving the same beautiful flags before us today, speaking those three glorious words:  “You are free.”It is this love of freedom, this embrace of human dignity, this call to courage in the face of evil that the survivors here today have helped to write onto our hearts.  The Jewish people have endured oppression, persecution, and those who have sought and planned their destruction.  Yet, through the suffering, they have persevered.  They have thrived.  And they have enlightened the world.  We stand in awe of the unbreakable spirit of the Jewish people.I want to close with a story enshrined in the Museum that captures the moment of liberation in the final days of the war.  It is the story of Gerda Klein, a young Jewish woman from Poland. Some of you know her.  Gerda’s family was murdered by the Nazis. She spent three years imprisoned in labor camps, and the last four months of the war on a terrible death march.  She assumed it was over.  At the end, on the eve of her 21st birthday, her hair had lost all of its color, and she weighed a mere 68 pounds.  Yet she had the will to live another day.  It was tough. Gerda later recalled the moment she realized that her long-awaited deliverance had arrived.  She saw a car coming towards her.  Many cars had driven up before, but this one was different.  On its hood, in place of that wretched swastika, was a bright, beautiful, gleaming white star.  Two American soldiers got out. One walked up to her.  The first thing Gerda said was what she had been trained to say:  “We are Jewish, you know.”  “We are Jewish.”  And then he said, “So am I.”  It was a beautiful moment after so much darkness, after so much evil.As Gerda took this solider to see the other prisoners, the American did something she had long forgotten to even expect -- he opened the door for her.  In Gerda’s words, “that was the moment of restoration of humanity, of humanness, of dignity, and of freedom.” But the story does not end there.  Because, as some of you know, that young American soldier who liberated her and who showed her such decency would soon become her husband.  A year later, they were married.  In her words, “He opened not only the door for me, but the door to my life and to my future.” Gerda has since spent her life telling the world of what she witnessed.  She, like those survivors who are among us today, has dedicated her life to shining a light of hope through the dark of night.Your courage strengthens us.  Your voices inspire us.  And your stories remind us that we must never, ever shrink away from telling the truth about evil in our time.  Evil is always seeking to wage war against the innocent and to destroy all that is good and beautiful about our common humanity.  But evil can only thrive in darkness.  And what you have brought us today is so much more powerful than evil.  You have brought us hope -- hope that love will conquer hatred, that right will defeat wrong, and that peace will rise from the ashes of war.Each survivor here today is a beacon of light, and it only takes one light to illuminate even the darkest space.  Just like it takes only one truth to crush a thousand lies and one hero to change the course of history.  We know that in the end, good will triumph over evil, and that as long as we refuse to close our eyes or to silence our voices, we know that justice will ultimately prevail.So today we mourn.  We remember.  We pray.  And we pledge:  Never again. Thank you.  God bless you, and God bless Amer
2017-04-24;https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/04/24/remarks-president-trump-working-lunch-un-security-council-ambassadors;Remarks by President Trump at a Working Lunch with U.N. Security Council Ambassadors ;"This is a very, very important and powerful group of people, and it’s really wonderful to have you with us.  And I have to say, welcome to the White House.  It’s a privilege to have all of the ambassadors and their spouses.  You know, they were going to leave out the spouses, and I said, you must bring your spouses.  (Laughter.)  You know, I heard there were a lot of very angry spouses -- (laughter) -- and this is their first time to the White House.  So it’s a great honor to those of you that brought your wife or spouse.As you know, the United States holds the presidency of the Security Council this month, and I’m glad that we are continuing the tradition of hosting the Council’s ambassadors in our nation’s capital.  It’s our great honor, believe me.  I want to thank Ambassador Nikki Haley for her outstanding leadership, and for acting as my personal envoy on the Security Council.  She’s doing a good job.  Now, does everybody like Nikki?  Because if you don’t -- (laughter) -- otherwise, she can easily be replaced.  (Laughter.)  No, we won’t do that, I promise.  We won’t do that.  She’s doing a fantastic job.  And everyone, I see -- even as we took pictures before -- the friendship that you’ve developed, all of you together.  That’s really a fantastic thing.The mission of the United Nations and the U.N. Security Council is to maintain international peace and security.  These are important aims and shared interests.  But as we look around the world, it’s clear that there is much work for you to achieve.  You’re going to be very busy people, I suspect, over these coming months and years.  Our nation faces serious and growing threats, and many of them stem from problems that have been unaddressed for far too long.  In fact, the United Nations doesn’t like taking on certain problems.  But I have a feeling that people in this room -- and I know for a fact that Nikki feels very, very strongly about taking on problems that really people steered away from.I encourage the Security Council to come together and take action to counter all of these many threats.  On Syria, the Council failed again this month to respond to Syria’s use of chemical weapons.  A great disappointment; I was very disappointed by that.  The status quo in North Korea is also unacceptable, and the Council must be prepared to impose additional and stronger sanctions on North Korean nuclear and ballistic missile programs.  This is a real threat to the world, whether we want to talk about it or not.  North Korea is a big world problem, and it’s a problem we have to finally solve.  People have put blindfolds on for decades, and now it’s time to solve the problem.For the United Nations to play an effective role in solving these and other security challenges, big reforms will be required.  In addition, we must also take a close look at the U.N. budget.  Costs have been -- absolutely gone out of control.  But I will say this:  If we do a great job, I care much less about the budget, because you’re talking about peanuts compared to the important work you’re doing.  You really are.  You’re talking about the most important things ever.  And I must say, I’m a budget person.  You see the way I’m talking about NATO, the same thing, but if you do a great job at the United Nations, I feel much differently about it because we’re talking pennies compared to the kind of lives and money that you’ll be saving.  The United States, just one of 193 countries in the U.N., pays for 22 percent of the budget and almost 30 percent of the United Nations peacekeeping, which is unfair.  We need the member states to come together to eliminate inefficiency and bloat, and to ensure that no one nation shoulders a disproportionate share of the burden militarily or financially.  This is only fair to our taxpayers.I look forward to a productive discussion about our shared role in keeping the peace, advancing reforms, and getting everyone to do their fair share.  I also want to say to you that I have long felt the United Nations is an underperformer but has tremendous potential.  There are those people that think it’s an underperformer and will never perform.  I think -- and I think especially I’m so happy with the job that Nikki is doing and our representatives -- but Nikki and the group -- and I see the relationship that she has already developed.  I think that the United Nations has tremendous potential -- tremendous potential -- far greater than what I would say any other candidate in the last 30 years would have even thought to say.  I don’t think it’s lived up -- I know it hasn’t lived up to the potential.  I mean, I see a day when there’s a conflict where the United Nations, you get together, and you solve the conflict.  You just don’t see the United Nations, like, solving conflicts.  I think that’s going to start happening now.  I can see it.  And the United Nations will get together and solve conflicts.  It won’t be two countries, it will be the United Nations mediating or arbitrating with those countries.  So I see fantastic potential and fantastic things ahead for the United Nations.  And I have to say, it’s a tremendous honor to know you and to meet you.  And Nikki has given me a little briefing on each and every one of you, and I must tell you -- I will tell you, you know, I’m a very blunt person, if she didn’t like I would tell you right now -- (laughter) -- but she gets along with everybody and respects everybody in this room.I’ll end by saying that -- unless you would rather not do it -- so we have an office in the White House, you may have heard of it, called the Oval Office.  So what we'll do is we'll go down as a group and we'll take some pictures in the Oval Office.  I know you’ve never seen it.  Nobody seems to get to see the Oval Office very much, but we’re going to show you the Oval Office.  So we’ll go down, take some pictures of the Oval Office, and we’ll have a good luncheon, and we’ll talk about the United Nations and we’ll talk about peace.Thank you all very much for being here.  It’s a great honor, and I’m glad "

Please call Station for a voice check.THE PRESIDENT:  Do you hear me?CMDR. WHITSON:  Yes, sir.  We have you loud and clear.THE PRESIDENT:  Well, that's what we like -- great American equipment that works.  And this isn’t easy.  (Laughter.)  I want to say it’s very exciting to be here today -- very, very exciting -- and to speak to you live with three brave American astronauts.  These are our finest.  These are great, great Americans, great people.  Two join us from orbit aboard the International Space Station:  Commander Peggy Whitson and Colonel Jack Fischer.  And Peggy Whitson has been setting records, and we're going to talk about that very soon.I'm here in the Oval Office, along with my daughter Ivanka and astronaut Kate Rubins, who recently returned from space and from the Space Station.  Together, we are being joined by students all across America, thousands and thousands of students who are learning -- they're learning about space, learning about a lot of other things -- and they're watching this conversation from the classroom.  And, all over, we have astronauts and we have everybody, who are flying right now, 17,000 miles per hour.  That's about as fast as I've ever heard.  I wouldn’t want to be flying 17,000 miles an hour.  But that's what you do.Peggy, Jack, and Kate, I know that America’s students are thrilled to hear from you.  But first, I want to say that this is a very special day in the glorious history of American spaceflight.  Today, Commander Whitson, you have broken the record for the most total time spent in space by an American astronaut -- 534 days and counting.  That's an incredible record to break.  And on behalf of our nation and, frankly, on behalf of the world, I'd like to congratulate you.  That is really something.  And I'd like to know, how does it feel to have broken such a big and important record? CMDR. WHITSON:  Well, it's actually a huge honor to break a record like this, but it's an honor for me basically to be representing all the folks at NASA who make this spaceflight possible and who make me setting this record feasible.  And so it's a very exciting time to be at NASA.  We are all very much looking forward, as directed by your new NASA bill -- we're excited about the missions to Mars in the 2030s.  And so we actually, physically, have hardware on the ground that's being built for the SLS rocket that's going to take us there.  And, of course, the hardware being built now is going to be for the test flights that will eventually get us there.But it's a very exciting time, and I'm so proud of the team.THE PRESIDENT:  Great.  And what are we learning from having you spending your time up there?  I know so much research is done; I'm getting a glimpse of some of it right here in the Oval Office.  What are we learning by being in space?CMDR. WHITSON:  Well, I think probably the International Space Station is providing a key bridge from us living on Earth to going somewhere into deep space.  So on those Mars missions, we need to better understand how microgravity is really affecting our body, and we need to understand it in great detail.  So, many of the studies are looking at the human body.  We're also looking at things that involve operations of a space vehicles on these long-duration missions and the technological advancements that will be required.  For instance, on a multiyear Mars mission, we're going to need to be able to close the life support system, and that means we, right now, for instance, are taking solar power that we collect, and using it to break apart water into oxygen and hydrogen.  The oxygen, we breathe, of course.  We use the hydrogen, combine it back with the CO2 that we take out of the air, and make more water.  But water is such a precious resource up here that we also are cleaning up our urine and making it drinkable.  And it's really not as bad as it sounds.THE PRESIDENT:  Well, that's good.  I'm glad to hear that.  (Laughter.)  Better you than me.  I will say, Colonel Fischer, you just arrived, and how was your trip?  Complicated?  Easy?  How did it go?COL. FISCHER:  Oh, sir, it was awesome.  It made even my beloved F-22 feel a little bit underpowered.  I launched in a Russian vehicle with my Russian friend, Fyodor Yurchikhin, from Kazakhstan.  Got the immediate perspective change as we got to orbit, and I saw that frail, thin blue line of life around the Earth.  Six hours later, we're docked at the station.  The next day, I install an experiment in the Japanese module that's going to be looking at new drugs and how we can make those drugs for muscular dystrophy, Alzheimer's, multi-drug-resistant bacteria -- all sorts of things.  A couple hours later, I watched our crewmate, Thomas Pesquet, a Frenchman, drive a Canadian robotic arm to capture a spaceship from Virginia, carrying 3.5 tons of cargo and science that's going to keep us busy for the next few months, and dock that to the station.Sir, it's amazing.  Oh, and then, you know, now I'm talking to the President of the United States while hanging from a wall.  It's amazing.  The International Space Station is, by far, the best example of international cooperation and what we can do when we work together in the history of humanity.  And I am so proud to be a part of it.  And it's just cool.  (Laughter.)  Like, yesterday, I had -- well, there you go -- there's our resident space ninja doing the gravity demonstration.  And yesterday morning, I had my coffee in floaty ball form, and, sir, it was delicious.  So, it's awesome.THE PRESIDENT:  Tell me, Mars -- what do you see a timing for actually sending humans to Mars?  Is there a schedule?  And when would you see that happening?CMDR. WHITSON:  Well, I think as your bill directed, it will be approximately in the 2030s.  As I mentioned, we actually are building hardware to test the new heavy launch vehicle, and this vehicle will take us further than we've ever been away from this planet.  Unfortunately, spaceflight takes a lot of time and money, so getting there will require some international cooperation to get it to be a planet-wide approach in order to make it successful, just because it is a very expensive endeavor.  But it so worthwhile doing.THE PRESIDENT:  Well, we want to try and do it during my first term or, at worst, during my second term.  So we'll have to speed that up a little bit, okay?  CMDR. WHITSON:  (Laughter.)  We'll do our best.  THE PRESIDENT:  Oh, you will.  And I have great respect for you folks.  It's amazing what you do.  And I just want to introduce another great one.  Kate Rubins is with us today, and she has been so impressive with research and so many other things having to do with NASA.  And, Kate, I understand you're the first person to sequence DNA in space.  Can you tell us about that?DR. RUBINS:  Yeah.  So that was actually just this last summer, and it's a real example of what we can do with technology and innovation.  We've got a sequencer down to the size of your cellphone, and we were actually able to fly that onboard the space station and sequence DNA.  It's not just the technology demonstration, but we can actually use that to do things like detect microbes on the space station, look at astronaut health.  We can easily use that in Earth-based settings, too, to look for disease outbreaks and to do rural healthcare as well.THE PRESIDENT:  That's fantastic.  That is really great.  I saw some of the work, and it's incredible.  You know, I've been dealing with politicians so much, I'm so much more impressed with these people.  You have no idea.  Now, speaking of another impressive person -- Ivanka, you've been very much interested in this program.  Tell us something about it.MS. TRUMP:  Hi, Dr. Whitson.  First of all, congratulations on your incredible milestone today.  You may know that my father recently signed the Inspire Women Act to encourage female participation in STEM fields across all aerospace areas, and really with a focus on NASA.  So encouraging women and girls to pursue STEM careers is a major priority for this administration.And today we are sitting with an amazing example of that -- Dr. Rubins, and you, Dr. Whitson.  So I would love to hear from you, what was the impetus for you to get involved in the sciences?DR. RUBINS:  Yeah, so when I around fifteen, I actually went to a conference, and that was very inspiring for me.  It was sort of the beginning of recombinant DNA and understanding biology.  And so just that exposure to scientists and the kinds of things that you can do with science and technology innovation.MS. TRUMP:  Amazing.  Dr. Whitson?CMDR. WHITSON:  For me, it was actually the Apollo program was my inspiration, and that was when it became a dream to become an astronaut.  But I don’t really think it became a goal until I graduated from high school, when the first female astronauts were selected.  And seeing those role models, and with the encouragement of my parents and various mentors in college and graduate school, and when I started working at Rice, that’s what made it possible, I think, to become an astronaut.  And it took me a lot longer to become an astronaut than I ever really wanted it to take, but I do think I’m better at my job because of the journey.MS. TRUMP:  You’re an incredible inspiration to us all.  So I would also like to ask you one more question.  I’m incredibly curious, as I’m sure all the students across the country are, to know what a day in the life in space is like.  Could you share what a typical day looks like, what the challenges are, just any special moments?CMDR. WHITSON:  Well, a typical day, we wake up and look at the messages from the ground, because we have a huge ground team that’s working overnight to prepare changes or the details of the tests that we’re going to be performing over the course of the day.  So first thing I do is check out that, see what’s changed.  But on any given day, it can be so dramatically different.  On one day, we might be focusing on science.  On another day, we might be repairing the carbon dioxide removal system.  On another day, soon Jack and I are going to do a spacewalk.  We talked about, last Saturday, we did robotics operations.  I love the diversity of the different activities that we do.  Plus, you know, we have over 200 investigations ongoing onboard the space station, and I just think that’s a phenomenal part of the day.Of course, there’s also just the living and, onboard the space station, it’s such a unique and novel environment.  Nothing that we’re used to on the ground.  And it’s so special to just be in zero gravity.  So Jack is the new guy here, and I think he can probably give you a better perspective on what that’s like.  COL. FISCHER:  Well, you know, everything here -- my dad always said that if you love what you do, you never work a day in your life.  And we work really hard up here, but it’s not really work, it’s just fun.  It’s like playing fort almost, only you’re changing the world while you do it.  And then on the off time, the other morning I was working out, and on our machine that we work out on, right below it is the Cupola window.  And so when you’re on the device where you do crunches, every time you come up, you see out the window.  And it’s awesome because you kind of go, crunch, ""Oh, my gosh, that’s beautiful!  I got to do that again.""  Crunch, ""Oh my gosh, that’s beautiful.""  It’s awesome.  Everything we do here is fun, and it feels so great to know that we’re making a difference on the ground and for the future of humanity as well.  So it’s an incredible, incredible job.  THE PRESIDENT:  You’re making a great difference, I have to say.  And this is a very exciting time for our country, and you see what’s happening with our country in terms of jobs, in terms of business, and there’s such excitement and such enthusiasm.  Many American entrepreneurs are racing into space.  I have many friends that are so excited about space.  They want to get involved in space from the standpoint of entrepreneurship and business.  Tell us about the opportunities that could exist for the next generation of scientists and engineers.  Is that something that you think a student -- because you have so many students, hundreds of thousands watching -- is that something that you think that students should be focusing, or should they be thinking about other subjects?  What do you think are the opportunities for young students wanting to be involved in space?COL. FISCHER:  Sir, absolutely.  I think that this is probably the most exciting in space exploration, certainly in my lifetime.  We are about to just have an explosion of activity.  There is so much involvement on the space station with commercial industries and commercial partners.  We have an entire program to manage the science.  NASA has done a wonderful job of seeding a new industry with the Commercial Crew Program and the Commercial Cargo Program so that we can build the infrastructure we need for the future exploration.  One thing I love about American entrepreneurs is, once you get them going, you better stand out of their way because they’re going to start chucking.  And we’re about to that point.  NASA is taking on that expensive, hard, complex task of going further and deeper into space with the wonderful new rocket, Space Launch System and Orion.  And then, as soon as we break open that door, this incredible infrastructure that we’ve been building is going to be right there to pick up the baton and continue into the stars.  I would say to all the students that are watching, the time to get excited is now.  If you aren’t studying science and math, you might want to think about that because our future in the stars starts now, and you can be a part of that if, like Dr. Whitson, you can find that passion and work really hard.  And we’re going to find a permanent foothold in the stars for humanity if you do that.THE PRESIDENT:  Well, thank you.  So well said.  And I have to say, there’s tremendous military application in space.  We’re rebuilding our military like never before.  We’re ordering equipment, and we’re going to have the strongest military that we’ve ever had, the strongest military that the world has ever seen, and there’s been no time where we need it more.  And I’m sure that every student watching wants to know, what is next for Americans in space.  I’m very proud that I just signed a bill committing NASA to the aim of sending America astronauts to Mars.  So we’ll do that.  I think we’ll do it a lot sooner than we’re even thinking.  So which one of you is ready to go to Mars?  Are you ready?  And I think you’re ready.  I know you’re ready, right?  We just discussed that.  She’d like to go to Mars very quickly.  Who’s ready to go to Mars up there? CMDR. WHITSON:  We are absolutely ready to go to Mars.  It’s going to be a fantastic journey getting there, and very exciting times, and all of us would be happy to go.  But I want all the young people out there to recognize that the real steps are going to be taken in a few years.  And so by studying math, science, engineering, any kind of technology, you’re going to have a part in that, and that will be very exciting.THE PRESIDENT:  I just want to thank you very much.  And, Dr. Whitson, I just -- congratulations.  Amazing.  What an amazing thing that you’ve done.  Everybody here -- I know you’re family -- but everybody here is incredibly proud of the record you just broke.  I hope that every young American watching today finds, in your example, a reason to love space and think about space because many great things are going to come out, tremendous discoveries in medicine and so many other fields.So thank you very much.  I want to say God bless you, God bless America.  We are very, very proud of you, a"
2017-04-21;https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/04/21/remarks-president-trump-signing-financial-services-executive-orders;Remarks by President Trump at Signing of Financial Services Executive Orders;"Thank you very much, Steve.  Great honor, I must say.  It’s a great pleasure to be at the United States Treasury Department and to meet so many dedicated public servants.  I went through that beautiful hallway where those incredible paintings of past secretaries, and it was really very interesting.  I want to read every one, I want to learn about every one of them, but we have one that I hope will go down as one of the greats.  I think Hamilton is tough to beat, but maybe you can do that too.  We’ll take it, right?  But thank you very much.  The Treasury Department is the guardian of America’s wealth and a worldwide symbol of American prestige.  This department was first led by the same gentleman, Alexander Hamilton, a man who understood that the government must protect the jobs of its citizens and the wealth of our nation.Secretary Mnuchin, who I’ve known for so long, and he’s so good and so smart and so financially adept, is working very hard every day to do just that -- to protect the working citizen of America, and to safeguard our finances from anyone, anybody, any nation who would try to take advantage of the United States.  His vast experience and financial talent are now being put into service on behalf of the American people.  And you’ll see what I mean very soon.We have taken unprecedented action to bring back our jobs and return power to our citizens.  It’s been taken away.  We’ve lifted one terrible regulation after another at a record clip, from the energy sector to the auto sector.  And we have many more to go, and that’s going to be happening over the next, I would say, four to five weeks.  And we’ve begun a historic effort to protect our manufacturing and our manufacturing businesses, companies and our workers from unfair foreign trade.Protecting our Treasury also means getting other countries to finally pay their fair share for the cost of defense, and many other global projects that for too long have fallen under our guidance and, unfortunately, fallen under the United States taxpayer expense.  And we’re going to end that; we're going to end it quickly.  We want fairness.  We don’t want to take advantage of anyone.  We want fairness.We’re now in the process of rebuilding America, and there’s a new optimism sweeping across our country like people have not seen in many, many decades.  We’re here today to continue this great economic revival.  I will be signing three presidential directives to further protect our workers and our taxpayers.The first executive action instructs Secretary Mnuchin to begin the process of tax simplification.  Such a big thing.  People can’t do their returns.  They have no idea what they’re doing.  They’re too complicated.  This regulatory reduction is the first step toward a tax reform that reduces rates, provides relief to our middle class, and lowers our business tax, which is one of the highest in the world and has stopped us from so much wealth and productivity.Secretary Mnuchin is a leader in our effort to make America competitive again.  We're going to make it great again, we're going to make it strong again, we're going to make it safe again, and we're going to make it competitive again.  I'm also issuing two directives that instruct Secretary Mnuchin to review the damaging Dodd-Frank regulations that failed to hold Wall Street firms accountable.  I mean, they've done really, in many cases, the opposite of what they were supposed to.  These regulations enshrine ""too big to fail"" and encourage risky behavior.  We're taking steps to make our economy more fair and prosperous for all.  As part of our broader financial strategy, we're working to open up lending to small businesses and entrepreneurs, including our incredible women entrepreneurs who are doing better and better and better.  We want opportunity for everyone and in every single part of our country.Secretary Mnuchin and my entire administration are working around the clock to help struggling Americans achieve their financial dreams, earn a great paycheck, have a job that they love going to every single day, and have real confidence in the future.  Together, we will restore prosperity to this nation, a nation that we so dearly love, and to bring people -- who call this home -- into a great, great way of living and a great way of life.   They're going to be thrilled.  We're going to be thrilled.  And you're going to be seeing some very, very major changes.  You've already seen them.  I don’t know if anybody has looked recently, but if you looked at optimism indexes that are just coming out, manufacturing in particular, where it's up to the highest point it's ever been -- 93 percent -- it was a 27 percent increase over the past, over the last one.So I just want to thank everybody for being here.  This is such a privilege for me to sign.  This is really the beginning of a whole new way of life that this country hasn’t seen in really many, many years.  I want to thank you, and I want to God bless America.  Thank you.  Thank you, everybody.So this is identifying and reducing tax regulatory burdens.  That covers a lot of territory, believe me.  (The President signs the executive order.)  This is the subject of Financial Stability, the Oversight Council.  Very important.  (The President signs the executive order.)  This is Orderly Liquidation Authority.  It doesn’t sound like much, but it is.  That's a biggie.  It doesn’t sound good, but it is.(The President signs the executive order.)  And we'll be having a big announcement on Wednesday having to do with tax reform.  The process has begun long ago, but it really formally begins on Wednesday.  So g"

(Applause.)  These are great, great people and these are real workers.  I love the workers.  We're doing a good job for the workers.  And I’m thrilled to be back in Wisconsin.  The optimism in this room is the same incredible spirit that is sweeping across our country -- and even greater than that great day in November when I won the state of Wisconsin and when we won the presidency.  That was a great day.  (Applause.)  That was a great day.  And thank you, Wisconsin.  No administration has accomplished more in the first 90 days -- that includes on military, on the border, on trade, on regulation, on law enforcement -- we love our law enforcement -- and on government reform.   Today, we’re building on that optimism, and I'm proud to announce that we're about to take bold, new steps to follow through on my pledge to Buy American and Hire American.  (Applause.)  I can’t think of a better place to make this announcement than right here at Snap-On -- I just took a tour of the company -- good place, by the way; it's doing well, too -- standing among the workers who make the tools that will rebuild our nation.  Your craftsmanship is incredible. It’s a pleasure to be see my good friend, Governor Scott Walker.  He has been such a big help.  He has been so incredible. (Applause.)  Stand up, Scott.  Governor Walker.  As well as Senator Ron Johnson.  We worked hard together.  Thank you, Ron.  (Applause.)  And although he could not be here today, my thanks go to Speaker Ryan, who’s represented this city for nearly two decades in Congress.  And you know where he is?  He’s with NATO -- so he has a good excuse.  And I said, Ron, make sure these countries start paying their bills a little bit more.  They’re way, way behind, Ron.  We have to -- or I'm going to talk to you about that, Ron.  But Paul, you're over with NATO -- get them to pay their bills.  And, Ron, you have to work on that, too.  And, Scott, you're right here in Wisconsin -- you don't have to bother.  We'll keep you right here.  (Laughter.)  For a little while at least.Also with us is a famous local resident, the pride of Kenosha -- Reince Priebus, my Chief of Staff.  Where is Reince?  (Applause.)  Where is he?  What a good man.  There he is.  In fact, we flew over his house on the way up and he got all excited, he was taking pictures of it.  (Laughter.)  Reince went to high school right here, just about a mile away, where he took his wife Sally to the prom.  And that was a match made in heaven.  Very nice.I also want to thank Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin for being with us today.  Secretary Mnuchin is working to put together a tax reform plan to make our industry more competitive and also to provide a level playing field for our workers.  We don't have a level playing field, believe me.  You're going to have one very soon.  And our tax reform and tax plan is coming along very well.  It's going to be out very soon.  We're working on healthcare and we're going to get that done, too.Our Education Secretary, Betsy DeVos, is also here.  Where is Betsy?  She’s around here someplace.  Stand up.  Thank you, Betsy.  (Applause.)  Secretary DeVos is working to ensure that our workers are trained for the skilled technical jobs that will, in the future, power our country.  I’m excited to be joined today by students from Gateway Technical College -- (applause) -- and remember the college president, Bryan Albrecht.  Thank you.  (Applause.)  Great job.  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  Thank you, Bryan.  Your partnership with Snap-On is a great example of why vocational education is the way of the future.When I was growing up in Queens, we had vocational schools that were great.  We don't have schools like that so much anymore, but we're bringing them back -- vocational schools.  These are very talented people that love that type of work, and it's great work.  It really is great work.  So vocational schools are going to be a big factor in the Trump administration. Together, we’re going to do everything in our power to make sure that more products are stamped with those wonderful words:  ""Made in the USA.""  (Applause.)  In the old days, we used to use it.  We don't use it so much anymore.  We're going to start using it again -- Made in the USA.For too long, we’ve watched as our factories have been closed and our jobs have been sent to other faraway lands.  We've lost 70,000 factories since China joined the World Trade Organization.  And you’ve seen that and you’ve heard about it -- 70,000.  The World Trade Organization -- another one of our disasters.  But this election, the American people voted to end the theft of American prosperity.  They voted to bring back their jobs -- and to bring back their dreams into our country.  That’s why I’m here today.  In just a few moments, I will be signing a Buy American and Hire American executive order.  You haven't heard about that in a long time in this country.  With this action, we are sending a powerful signal to the world:  We’re going to defend our workers, protect our jobs, and finally put America first.  (Applause.)  I see all the ""Make America Great Again"" hats, so it's a good crowd.  Those are good hats.  Through the years, Snap-On tools have been at the center of our industrial life.  Your tools have fixed the cars our families depend on.  They’ve sailed with the fleets that patrol the oceans.  They’ve fixed the planes that cross our skies.  And Snap-On tools have reached the heights of space, used by astronauts in orbit to carry out their very, very important work.  And I don’t know if you noticed, recently I signed a very big order:  We're going to spend again on the NASA space program, and that's something we need, and we also need it psychologically.  (Applause.)  But it's going to be very exciting.  For decades, this company has served the needs of American workers.  It’s time we had a federal government that does the same.  The “Buy and Hire American” order I'm about to sign will help protect workers and students like those of you in the audience today.  This historic action declares that the policy of our government is to aggressively promote and use American-made goods and to ensure that American labor is hired to do the job.  It's America first, you better believe it.  (Applause.)  It's time.  It's time, right?  It's time.  First, we will fully monitor, uphold and enforce our Buy American laws -- which we haven’t done.  Buy American laws require that when the federal government buys, builds or funds a project, domestic goods and products should be used.  But over the years, these Buy American standards have been gutted by excessive waivers and reckless exemptions.  The result has been countless jobs and countless contracts that have been lost to cheap, subsidized, and low-quality foreign goods.  With this order, I am directing every single agency in our government to strictly uphold our Buy American laws, to minimize the use of waivers, and to maximize Made in America content in all federal projects.  (Applause.)  It's time.  And for the first time ever, we are going to crack down on foreign bidders that used dumped steel and other subsidized goods to take contracts from workers like you.  They take them away, and they've been doing it for a long time.  Not going to happy anymore.  (Applause.)  We are finally standing up for our workers and for our companies.  In short, this order declares that American projects should be made with American goods.  No longer are we going to allow foreign countries to cheat our producers and our workers out of federal contracts.  Everyone in my administration will be expected to enforce every last Buy American provision on behalf of the American worker, and we are going to investigate every single trade deal that undermines these provisions.Secondly, we are going to enforce the Hire American rules that are designed to protect jobs and wages of workers in the United States.  We believe jobs must be offered to American workers first.  Does that make sense?  (Applause.)  Right now, widespread abuse in our immigration system is allowing American workers of all backgrounds to be replaced by workers brought in from other countries to fill the same job for sometimes less pay.  This will stop.  American workers have long called for reforms to end these visa abuses.  And today, their calls are being answered for the first time.  That includes taking the first steps to set in motion a long-overdue reform of H1B visas.  Right now, H1B visas are awarded in a totally random lottery -- and that's wrong.  Instead, they should be given to the most-skilled and highest-paid applicants, and they should never, ever be used to replace Americans.  No one can compete with American workers when they're given a fair and level playing field, which has not happened for decades.  We're using every tool at our disposal to restore the American Dream.  In fact, when it comes to wasteful, destructive, job-killing regulations, we are going to use a tool you all know very well -- it's called the sledgehammer.  (Laughter.)  It's what we're going to use.  We're also going to stand up for our dairy farmers in Wisconsin -- (applause) -- and I've been reading about it, and I've been talking about it for a long time -- and that demands, really, immediately fair trade with all of our trading partners, and that includes Canada.  (Applause.)  Because in Canada, some very unfair things have happened to our dairy farmers and others, and we're going to strategy working on that with Ron and with Scott and with Paul, with all of your representatives.  What's happened to you is very, very unfair.  It's another typical one-sided deal against the United States.  And it's not going to be happening for long.  So, Scott, you and Ron and myself and Paul and everybody else, we're going to get together and we're going to call Canada, and we're going to say, ""What happened?""  And they might give us an answer, but we're going to get the solution, not just the answer, okay?  Because we know what the solution is, all right?  (Applause.)  And if you guys can't do it, we'll bring maybe Reince.  Reince, you ready, Reince?  We better bring Reince back.  No, we'll get that done.  We're going to work on that very hard.  We're going to work on it immediately; in fact, starting today.  It's a terrible thing that happened to the farmers of Wisconsin.The fact is, NAFTA has been a disaster for the United States -- a complete and total disaster.  And we’re going to do some things, and we have all sorts of rules and regulations that are horrendous.  Like we want to start to negotiate with Mexico immediately, and we have these provisions where you have to wait long periods of time, you have to notify Congress, and after you notify Congress, you have to get certified, and then you can’t speak to them for 100 days.  The whole thing is ridiculous.NAFTA has been very, very bad for our country.  It’s been very, very bad for our companies and for our workers, and we’re going to make some very big changes or we are going to get rid of NAFTA for once and for all.  Cannot continue like this, believe me.  (Applause.)  Big things will be happening on trade with other countries over the coming months, and I mean very big.  We’re also working with Congress on tax reform and simplification, and we’re on time if we get that healthcare approval.  So press every one of your congressmen, press everybody, because we want to get that approval.  And it just makes the tax reform easier and it makes it better.  But it’s going to make it steeper, it’s going to be bigger, and that’s what we want to do.So we’re in very good shape on tax reform.  We have the concept of the plan.  We’re going to be announcing it very soon.  But healthcare -- we have to get the healthcare taken care of.  And as soon as healthcare takes care of -- we are going to march very quickly.  You’re going to watch -- we’re going to surprise you.  Right, Steve Mnuchin?  Right?  Secretary of Treasury.  (Applause.)  I see Sean.  Stand up, Sean.  Stand up.  I had no idea -- I was told a year ago -- he’s been so great to me -- I was told a year ago he’s like a world champion climber; climbs the trees.  And after that I look -- every time I look at him, I look at him now differently.  I’m very impressed with that, Sean.  And he’s also very good on television and very helpful.  Thank you.  Thank you, man.  Thank you.  We’ll be making big investments in rebuilding our military and repairing our badly depleted infrastructure.  And that will happen soon also -- infrastructure.  Big infrastructure bill, probably use it with something else that’s a little bit harder to get approved in order to get that approved.  But infrastructure is coming, and it’s coming fast.New ships, bridges, tunnels and airplanes will be constructed with American hands, American steel, and, yes, American tools.  (Applause.)  As we work to restore the American Dream at home, we’re also working to restore America’s standing abroad.  That means strengthening our partnerships and ensuring that our friends and allies pay their fair share, and that very much includes, as I’ve already said in my little statement to Paul, it also includes the NATO companies and countries.  They are really sort of letting us down in that one respect, and we don’t want people taking advantage of the United States.  And that’s not going to happen for very much longer.  I’m going over there very soon and we’re going to have it, and everybody is going to be paying.  And we’re going to be a much happier country, we’re going to be a much happier world.No matter the circumstances, everyone will know we act from this core conviction that America’s strength must be unmatched and its first priority unquestioned -- the safety and security of our citizens.  This is the surest path to a more peaceful and prosperous world for us all.Together, we can build a better future in the spirit of this company’s earliest days.  Great company, great history.  I recently learned that decades ago, in the 1920s, when your salesman entered a dusty repair shop, or stained, a nice, beautiful stained garage floor -- which I’ve seen many of -- they would find a spot to lay out a beautiful green felt mat.  The people of the company know what that means.  And on that green felt mat, he would carefully place a gleaming set of new Snap-On tools.The founders of this company wanted their customers to know that the tools of the mechanic were just as important as the tools of the doctor, the dentist, the politician, or the business leader, and that his craft was a noble, noble craft, as noble as any.  This is a wonderful story about your company and its Wisconsin heritage.  And Wisconsin has a truly great heritage, and it’s led by incredible people.But it’s also a story that tells us a lot about the American spirit.  In America, we honor work.  We honor grit.  We honor craftsmanship.  We honor the men and women who turn dreams into reality with their own two hands.  In America, we honor all of you.  We are a nation of builders.  We are the country that dug out the Panama Canal, that put a man on the face of the moon, and that linked our cities with majestic railroads and curving highways.  We are the country that is always on the cusp of the next invention.  But we can only get there with all of you.  We can only restore this nation we love so much by working and building with all of you.We can only get there together.  We are the one people sharing one destiny, saluting one great, beautiful American flag.  I’m thrilled to be here today to celebrate our great American heritage and to proudly embrace our great American future.  I want to thank the people of Wisconsin for doing so much for me.  That’s why I came back here -- not just for the company, frankly, for the people of Wisconsin.  You have been so incredible to me and my administration, and we will never, ever let you down.  God bless you.  God bless the American worker.  God bless the American Dream.  And God bless the United States of America.  Thank you all very"

Sit down, please.  Come on, get up here with me, everybody.CHIEF BAKER:  Sir, I bring you greetings on behalf of our honorable mayor, Mayor Kasim Reed.  And our men and women of the Atlanta Fire Rescue Department would like to present you with a token of our appreciation.  THE PRESIDENT:  That is beautiful.  I think I should leave it right here, right?  It fits so well.  Thank you.CHIEF BAKER:  Thank you, sir.THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  I didn’t know I was going to get such a nice -- that is fantastic.  Thank you, how are you?  CHIEF BAKER:  I'm fine, sir.THE PRESIDENT:  We're going to go around and introduce ourselves, okay?  We'll do this first.  You know, these folks back here, they're very famous -- most of them -- it's called the media.  (Laughter.)  They're very honorable people.  But you are more honorable, I can tell you that. CHIEF BAKER:  Thank you, sir.THE PRESIDENT:  So I'm honored to be here with you today and welcome you to the White House.  The heroes who responded to the terrible bridge collapse on I-85 two weeks ago in Atlanta.  That was something.  The whole world was watching that one.  Today we're joined by members of the Georgia State Patrol, the Atlanta Fire Rescue Department, and the Atlanta Police Department -- great people.  On that day, Georgia State police and Atlanta police took fast action to get motorists away from danger.  Then, our brave firefighters battled 40-foot flames, which was incredible.  What was the reason for those flames?  It was something underneath that just was very combustible?CHIEF BAKER:  Yes, sir.THE PRESIDENT:  Yeah, those flames were amazing.  They pulled back, by battalion chiefs, and just minutes before the bridge itself collapsed and everybody was safe.  That was an amazing thing, and everybody was watching.  Your skill and courage saved many lives and represented true strength, and the true strength of America.  Really great job, fellas.  I'm proud of you.  Great job.  To the people of Georgia who were affected by the collapse, my administration stands with you.  We've already made a $10 million emergency relief fund available.  And I called your governor, who I know very well -- he's a terrific guy -- and I approved it literally the day that it happened.  I had a feeling you'd need a little money -- (laughter) -- because I look like a big money deal, right, Elaine?  But I approved it immediately, and Elaine took care of it, and we gave fast action.What happened in Atlanta is a painful reminder of the critical importance of infrastructure.  We're going to be doing a lot with infrastructure.  You'll be seeing that over the coming weeks -- a tremendous amount.  I'm committed to funding a massive nationwide infrastructure program to rebuild, repair, and construct the roads and bridges of the future of this country.  This is necessary as a matter of both safety and economic growth, and it's necessary to improve our quality of life as Americans.  We will also continue to seek proper funding for law enforcement and public safety in our country.  On behalf of the entire nation, I salute you -- you're really amazing people -- and I honor your service.  I pledge that you will have the support of our country -- the police, the firefighters, first responders -- you will always have the support of President Trump.  I think you know that very well.  And I thank you for the great job and the fast action.  Really fantastic.  A lot of bravery.  Maybe we could just go around and introduce yourselves.  And, who knows, maybe you'll become a movie star after this.  (Laughter.)  After all this, you'll become a movie star.  If they like the way you look or sound, you'll become a star.Go ahead.CHIEF BAKER:  Well, thank you again, sir.  My name is Joel Baker, the fire chief of the city of Atlanta Fire Rescue Department.THE PRESIDENT:  And how tall are you, Joel?CHIEF BAKER:  I'm 6'6"", sir.  THE PRESIDENT:  That's all?  I thought it was much more than that.  I think you're taller than that.  (Laughter.)  Okay, good.  Thank you very much.  I appreciate it.Go ahead.MR. BURKETT:  I'm Trooper Thomas Burkett with the Georgia State Patrol.MR. HEALD:  And I'm Sergeant Ryan Heald from the Atlanta Police Department.MR. MCLEMORE:  I'm Battalion Chief James McLemore from the Atlanta Fire Rescue Department.MR. GIUNTA:  I'm Trooper John Giunta with the Georgia State Patrol.MR. CAMPBELL:  I'm Sergeant Anthony Campbell, Atlanta Fire Rescue Airport Division.MR. BAKER:  I'm senior police officer Michael Baker from the Atlanta Police Department.SECRETARY CHAO:  Elaine Chao, Secretary of Transportation.MR. ADKINS:  Captain Arthur Adkins, Atlanta Fire Rescue Department.MR. TISDALE:  I'm Trooper Harold Tisdale, Jr. with the Georgia State Patrol.MR. MCKOY:  Trooper First Class Kendell McKoy, Georgia State Patrol.MR. BOSSERT:  I'm Tom Bossert.  I'm the President's Homeland Security Advisor.  MR. HATCHER:  Battalion Chief Douglas Hatcher, Atlanta Fire Rescue Department.MR. KUSRA:  Sergeant First Class Thomas Kustra with Georgia State Patrol.MR. BRYANT:  Assistant Chief of Atlanta Police Department, Rodney Bryant. THE PRESIDENT:  Great, Rodney.  Well, thank you very much.  So who's the bravest person in this room?  That's what I want to know.  Raise your hands if you're the bravest person.  Huh?  Maybe it's -- (laughter) -- I thought so.  I thought so.  SECRETARY CHAO:  Do you want --THE PRESIDENT:  Go ahead.MR. CRONIN:  Sergeant First Class John Cronin, Georgia State Patrol.MR. SEVERANCE:  Officer Ryan Severance with the Atlanta Police Department.THE PRESIDENT:  Elaine, would you like to say something?SECRETARY CHAO:  Mr. President, beside you and around you are true heroes of our country.  They demonstrate courage, steadfastness, commitment, and fealty to their oaths to serve our communities in need.This fire was reported at 6:12 p.m., right in the middle of rush hour, on March 30th.  By 6:20, this team was on site addressing the issues.  Governor Nathan Deal also deserves some credit because he has, as a matter of policy, pre-positioned state troopers around I-85 to move any traffic incident right out of the way.  So that helped a great deal.  By 7:00, the bridge had collapsed.  By 8:00, these brave men, leaders of their own communities, basically had the fire under control.  The U.S. Department of Transportation was on site, and we worked hand-in-hand with these great heroes.  And as you mentioned, $10 million from your administration went out within one hour of the governor making this request. The good story following all of this is also that the repairs and recovery of this whole scene will occur very quickly.  You will like them, because they will come in under budget and on time.THE PRESIDENT:  That's good.  I love to hear the words ""under budget"" and ""under schedule,"" right?  (Laughter.)  We used to call it ""ahead of schedule.""  Now we say ""under schedule.""  But that will be great.And I have to tell you, Governor Nathan Deal did call me immediately as this was happening, and he sort of said, could you be ready?  Because we're going to need some emergency money fast.  And we were ready and we got him the money immediately.And again, we want to thank everybody in the room very much.  And, Secretary, congratulations.SECRETARY CHAO:  Not at all.  Again, I told them that you are really approachable and that you would enjoy meeting them so much.  They were a little bit apprehensive about meeting you, so they're just so thrilled.  And Chief Baker and also Chief Bryant, these are the two leaders here, and they both said what an honor it is to be at the White House, to be with you.  And you have done the first responder community a tremendous honor by honoring them.  And they want to make sure -- because they're saying that you are sending a message to all the first responders that you value them.  So, Chief Bryant, why don’t you say that to the President?  (Laughter.) CHIEF BRYANT:  Yes, ma'am.  I stand with her, Mr. President, that this is not only a great day for the city of Atlanta and Atlanta Fire Rescue Department, but it's a great day for all the public safety personnel throughout the country to include the department of fire, police, state patrols throughout the country, corrections department.  But all the public safety really appreciate the opportunity that you're recognizing public safety members.THE PRESIDENT:  Well, Chief, I have great respect for the people that do what you do.  It's amazing bravery.  And the speed is incredible.  So, again, I want to thank you.  And I think what we'll do is, when we're finished here we'll talk, and then, unless you don’t want to do this, but I know you do, we'll go right across the hall to the Oval Office and we'll have some pictures.  Is that okay?  The Oval Office.  It is -- believe me, I've been in a lot of good offices.  (Laughter.)  It is a special office, okay?  So we'll go over there, we'll take some pictures, okay?CHIEF BRYANT:  Yes, sir.THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you all very much.Q    (Inaudible) bomb in Afghanistan?THE PRESIDENT:  It was really another successful job.  We're very, very proud of our military.  Just like we're proud of the folks in this room, we're so proud of our military.  And it was another successful event.  Q    Did you authorize this -- THE PRESIDENT:  Everybody knows exactly what happened.  And what I do is I authorize my military.  We have the greatest military in the world, and they've done their job as usual.  So we have given them total authorization, and that's what they're doing.  And, frankly, that's why they've been so successful lately.  If you look at what's happened over the last eight weeks and compare that really to what's happened over the last eight years, you'll see there's a tremendous difference -- tremendous difference.So we have incredible leaders in the military, and we have incredible military.  And we are very proud of them.  And this was another very, very successful mission.   Thank you very much.Q    Does this send a message to North Korea?THE PRESIDENT:  I don’t know if this sends a message.  It doesn’t make any difference if it does or not.  North Korea is a problem.  The problem will be taken care of.  I will say this:  I think China has really been working very hard.  I have really gotten to like and respect, as you know, President Xi.  He's a terrific person.  We spent a lot of time together in Florida.  And he's a very special man, so we'll see how it goe"

I think we have made tremendous progress in our relationship with China.  My representatives have been meeting one-on-one with their counterparts from China.  And I think, truly, progress has been made.  We'll be making a lot of additional progress.  The relationship developed by President Xi and myself I think is outstanding.  We look forward to being together many times in the future.  And I believe lots of very potentially bad problems will be going away.So I just want to thank President Xi for being with us in the United States.  It's a tremendous honor for me and all of my representatives to host the President and his representatives.  And again, progress has been made.Thank you very much.  Thank you.(President Xi speaks in Chinese.)PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Well, I agree 100 percent, Mr. President.  And thank you very much.  And again, a tremendous honor to have you in the U

2017-04-06;https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/04/06/statement-president-trump-syria;Statement by President Trump on Syria;My fellow Americans:  On Tuesday, Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad launched a horrible chemical weapons attack on innocent civilians.  Using a deadly nerve agent, Assad choked out the lives of helpless men, women, and children.  It was a slow and brutal death for so many.  Even beautiful babies were cruelly murdered in this very barbaric attack.  No child of God should ever suffer such horror.Tonight, I ordered a targeted military strike on the airfield in Syria from where the chemical attack was launched.  It is in this vital national security interest of the United States to prevent and deter the spread and use of deadly chemical weapons.  There can be no dispute that Syria used banned chemical weapons, violated its obligations under the Chemical Weapons Convention, and ignored the urging of the U.N. Security Council.  Years of previous attempts at changing Assad's behavior have all failed, and failed very dramatically.  As a result, the refugee crisis continues to deepen and the region continues to destabilize, threatening the United States and its allies.  Tonight, I call on all civilized nations to join us in seeking to end the slaughter and bloodshed in Syria, and also to end terrorism of all kinds and all types.  We ask for God's wisdom as we face the challenge of our very troubled world.  We pray for the lives of the wounded and for the souls of those who have passed.  And we hope that as long as America stands for justice, then peace and harmony will, in the end, prevail.  Goodnight.  A

THE PRESIDENT:  North Korea and trade.Q    And on North Korea, you had said in the -- interview that you’re willing to act alone if China doesn’t step up.  What are you going to try to get from the Chinese?THE PRESIDENT:  Certainly, I would be.  But I think China will want to be stepping up.Q    What do you want them to do specifically?THE PRESIDENT:  You’re going to see.  We’ll be talking about it.Q    Have you told members of Congress --THE PRESIDENT:  The President just arrived.  He just landed in Palm Beach, so I just saw that.  Q    Mr. President, have you told members of Congress that you’re considering using military action in Syria?THE PRESIDENT:  I don’t want to mention that, but the answer is no, I haven’t.Q    So what should we make now, going -- I think we’re ending the 13th week or so -- how your staff is doing?  Are you shaking things up and rebooting a little bit?THE PRESIDENT:  I’ve shaken them up, and I think we’ve had one of the most successful 13 weeks in the history of Presidents.  If you look at all that we’ve done and all of the jobs we’ve created, if you look at the kind of cost-cutting we’ve been able to achieve with the military and at the same time ordering vast amounts of equipment -- saved hundreds of millions of dollars on airplanes, and really billions, because if you take that out over a period of years it’s many billions of dollars -- I think we’ve had a tremendous success.  And we’ve just begun.  And we’re going to have a very interesting couple of days.Q    In terms of your staff, though, are you realigning your staff?Q    Are you committed to doing something in Syria?THE PRESIDENT:  I don’t want to say what I’m going to be doing with respect to Syria.Q    What would you like the Chinese president to do regarding North Korea?THE PRESIDENT:  We have been treated unfairly and have made terrible deals -- trade deals with China for many, many years.  So that’s one of the things we’re going to be talking about.  The other thing, of course, is going to be North Korea, and somehow they will mix.  They really do mix.  So we’re going to be talking about both trade, North Korea, and many other things.Q    Will the use of nuclear option change how you consider which nominees to put before the Senate?THE PRESIDENT:  No, not at all.  No.  We have a great person right now in Judge Gorsuch, I mean a great person.  And hopefully if there is a second one for me during my administration -- and there could be as many as four -- in fact, under a certain scenario there could even be more than that -- but no, I don’t think the nuclear option has any impact on that at all.Q    What do you think of Devin Nunes recusing himself this morning?  Were you briefed on that?  Was that a good decision?  THE PRESIDENT:  He’s a very good person.  I just heard that he did.  I think he’s a very good person, he’s a very honorable guy.  And I think he did that maybe for his own reason.  He’s a high-quality person.  And the gentleman replacing him, who I don’t know, I hear is a very, very highly respected man, high-quality.Q    -- for him sharing classified information?  Did he share classified information?  THE PRESIDENT:  With who?  What?Q    For the ethics investigation now undergoing for him sharing classified information.  Do you think he’s guilty of sharing classified information?THE PRESIDENT:  Nobody shared it with me, that I can tell you --  Q    Mr. President --THE PRESIDENT:  -- because I haven’t looked.Q    Mr. President, two questions.  Do you think Assad should leave power?  And will you discuss the Syria --THE PRESIDENT:  What Assad did is terrible.  I think what happened in Syria is one of the truly egregious crimes and it shouldn’t have happened and it shouldn’t be allowed to happen.  Q    Have you talked to Putin about this?  Will you talk to the Russian president about what happened?THE PRESIDENT:  At some point, I may.  I haven’t, but at some point I may.Q    Just to follow on that, though, do you think that Assad should leave power in Syria?THE PRESIDENT:  I think what happened in Syria is a disgrace to humanity.  And he’s there, and I guess he’s running things, so something should hap
2017-04-04;https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/04/04/remarks-president-trump-2017-north-americas-building-trades-unions;Remarks by President Trump at 2017 North America's Building Trades Unions National Legislative Conference;I know these people well, you wouldn’t believe it.  I know them too well.  (Applause.)  I know them too well.  They cost me a lot of money.  (Laughter.)  I spent a lot of money, but I love them, and they’re great, and their people are fantastic.  And nobody does it like you people, right?  Nobody.  We talked about that -- incredible.  Incredible people.So it’s great to be back with America’s builders.  (Applause.)  So did you ever think you’d see a President who knows how much concrete and rebar you can lay down in a single day?  Believe me, I know.  I know.  (Applause.)  We’re a nation of builders, and it was about time we had a builder in the White House, right?  (Applause.)  We have a builder. I want to thank Sean McGarvey and the entire governing board of presidents for honoring me with this great invitation.  And I love that it’s in Washington, because I don’t have to travel very far.  Worked out pretty well, I have to tell you.  Five minutes.  Sean took part in one of our very first meetings at the White House –- he mentioned it -- and I promise you that America’s labor leaders will always find an open door with Donald Trump.  Always.  (Applause.)  Just look at the amazing talent assembled here.  We have ironworkers, insulators -- (applause) -- never changes, does it, with the ironworkers?  Let’s hear it.  Laborers.  (Applause.)  Painters.  (Applause.)  Fitters.  (Applause.)  Plumbers.  (Applause.)  Operators -- they’re operators, all right, I’ll tell you that.  (Laughter.)  Electricians.  (Applause.)  Not that good.  Where’s my Local 3?  Where’s Local 3?  That wasn’t that good, the electricians -- well, they became so rich they don’t have to -- (laughter) -- let’s do that again.  Electricians.  (Applause.)  That’s better.  Bricklayers.  (Applause.)  Boilermakers.  (Applause.)  Elevator constructors.  (Applause.)  Good job.  Sheet-metal workers.  (Applause.)  Roofers.  (Applause.)  Plasterers -- plaster, well, yeah, that’s -- not using as much plaster as we used to, fellas, right?  No matter how you cut it.  Sorry about that.  I’m not sure I can do much -- we brought back the coalminers.  I’m not so sure about the plasterers.  We’ll do the best we can, okay?  We’re going to do the best we can.  How about the cement masons.  (Applause.)  And, of course, our wonderful Teamsters.  (Applause.)  Oh, that wasn’t very good, James.  But really, you’re the backbone of America.  With the talent in this room, we could build any city at any time, and we can build it better than anyone.  (Applause.)  But we’re going to do even better than that.  Together, we are going to rebuild our nation.  (Applause.)  You’re the keepers of the great trades and traditions that built our country from the New York skyline to the Golden Gate Bridge.  You represent the workers whose hands, skills, and dreams will build the great landmarks of our future.  Every day, your members live out what I call the American Creed.  They’re on the job before dawn and after dusk, and they never quit until that job is done.  You know that.  True.  True.  (Applause.) We saw this grit on display when the construction trades helped rebuild New York City after 9/11.  (Applause.)  That was a terrible time -- we were all there -- that was a terrible time in this country’s history.  Worst attack in the history of our country.  Worse than Pearl Harbor.  Pearl Harbor they were attacking military.  Here they were attacking civilians.  Worst attack.  And I saw what happened.  Within a very short period of time, we were back rebuilding, and rebuild you did.  And I really congratulate -- that took a lot of courage and a lot of strength. Thank you.  (Applause.) The fact is you take pride in every part of your work -- every joist, bolt, and rivet.  You’re not only builders, but you’re artisans, very talented people.  A lot of people don’t understand, you’re very talented people -- enriching our cities and landscapes with works of great beauty.  And just as you take pride in your work, our nation takes great, great pride in you, believe me.  And it’s time that we give you the level playing field you deserve.  (Applause.)  Thank you.  Thank you.  Washington and Wall Street have done very, very well for themselves.  Now it’s your turn.  And you’re going to be also sharing the wealth.  (Applause.)  And you know, for many years, we’ve been taken advantage of by other countries.  All over the world they took advantage of us.  We had leaders that didn’t have a clue or worse.  That’s not going to happen anymore, folks.  That’s not going to happen anymore.  And you see what’s going on right now.  In fact, the trade deficit went way down -- just announced before I got on stage.  And I will tell you, we’re going to have a whole different set of values when it comes to representing our country.  That I can tell you right now.  (Applause.) This election was all about returning power to the people.  I’ve spent my life working side-by-side with American builders, and now you have a builder as your President.  (Applause.)  One of my first acts as President was to stop one of the great sellouts of the American worker -- I immediately withdrew the United States from the disaster -- this would have been a disaster -- this would have been another NAFTA, which, by the way, is a disaster.  I took you out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership.  (Applause.)  Thank you.  That one wasn’t even close.  And you know it and I know it, everybody knows it.Next, I cleared the way for the construction of the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines.  (Applause.)  And it’s looking like that’s going to have about 42,000 jobs involved, those two jobs.  That some number of great people.  That’s a big, big, beautiful -- lot of people.  And Sean actually, and a whole group joined me in the Oval Office when we approved the Keystone permit.And I joked that day -- I said, can you imagine the head of this big Canadian company, in this case, they build pipelines -- and they failed.  Didn’t work.  They paid millions and millions and hundreds of millions of dollars to consultants and lawyers, and they failed.  And it was over.  And then one day Trump wins, and a few days later they get a knock on the door -- sir, the Keystone pipeline was just approved.  Can you imagine?  I want to see the expression on his face. And he’s a nice guy.  He actually -- they came to the office.  (Applause.)  Because I did say you have to use American steel, you have to fabricate it here.  Now, they had already bought 60-70 percent of it.  So you can't be too wild, right?  But I was signing the order, and I said, where did they buy this steel?  I didn’t like the answer.  I said, who fabricated the steel?  I didn’t like the answer.  I said, from now on we're going to put a clause -- got to be made in America.  We want American steel, made in America.  (Applause.)  Right on the box. 100 percent, right?  (Applause.)And you’ll be hearing more about this in the very near future.  But as time goes by, let’s say, over the next seven and three-quarters years -- meaning eight years -- (laughter.)We believe in two simple rules:  Buy American, and Hire American.  That's what it's going to be.  (Applause.)  And that's not just a slogan, it's a promise.  Believe me, that's a promise. (Applause.)  The era of economic surrender has come to an end.  It's come to an end.  We have surrendered as a country to outside interests.  The era of economic victory for our country has just begun.  You will see.  No longer will we listen to those failed consultants who’ve made one wrong prediction after another -- delivering nothing but soaring trade deficits and a big, fat, shrinking workforce.For decades now, we’ve watched as our factories have shuttered -- almost 70,000 factories -- our jobs have been stolen, and blue collar wages have declined.  We’ve seen the economic pain inflicted on our fellow Americans in Pittsburgh and Detroit and Baltimore.  We didn’t just offshore our jobs, we offshored a big, big part of the American Dream.We enriched foreign countries at the expense of our own country, the great United States of America.  But those days are over.  (Applause.)  I'm not -- and I don't want to be -- the President of the world.  I'm the President of the United States. And from now on, it’s going to be America First.  (Applause.)  We’re going to bring back our jobs -- and, yes, we’re going to bring back the American Dream.  As I traveled the nation, I heard the pleas of the forgotten men and women of our country -- the people who work hard and play by the rules, but who don’t have a voice.  Together, we are their voice, and they will never, ever be forgotten again.  That I can tell you.  (Applause.)  I don't know if you saw, but if you watch the Democrats now, the anger -- the anger and hatred, and they’re trying to figure out where did all these people came that voted for Donald Trump? Remember they said -- because the Electoral College is a very, very hard, they say, almost impossible for a Republican to win. The odds are stacked.  And they would say there’s no way to 270  -- you need 270 -- there’s no way to 270.  I heard that so much for a year -- I kept saying, maybe I shouldn’t be running.  You know, Sean, I said, maybe I shouldn’t run because there’s no way. The people are telling me -- the same people that say all of the bad stuff, they’re saying, there’s no way to 270.  But there was a way to 306.  But wasn’t that an exciting one?  Places that nobody entered -- Donald Trump has won the state of Michigan.  They go, what?  Donald Trump has won the state of Wisconsin.  They came out of the blue, and we didn’t even need them.  And we love those two states -- because we won the state of Pennsylvania, and we won Ohio, and Iowa, and North Carolina, and South Carolina, and Florida, and so many others.  We ran the coast.  And if you don't run it, you can't win.  Huge disadvantage, Electoral College.  It's very, very tough.  They say almost impossible for a Republican to win.  But I had the support of, I would say, I would say almost everybody in this room.We had tremendous -- we had tremendous support.  Oh, we did.  We had tremendous support.  (Applause.)  We had tremendous support.  And I'll tell you, we really had the support of the workers.  We had tremendous support of the workers.  But would you like to make a change, folks?  Would you like to make a change?  Because if anybody wants to make a change, you won't be having so many jobs.  That I can tell you.  Your jobs will be -- it will be a whole different story.  Because in the last decade, you lost over 750,000 -- think of this -- 750,000 construction jobs.  Real wages in the construction sector have fallen more than 15 percent since the 1970s.  We rank 39th in the world for construction permitting.  And approvals for infrastructure projects can take up to 10 years.Since taking office, I’ve signed one action after another to eliminate job-killing regulations that stand in the way.  I had a chart -- is that chart around here someplace?  Do you have that? I have to show this chart to you because it's amazing, actually.This is -- if you want to build a highway in the United States, these are some of the permits that you need.  It's a process that can take way over 10 years.  And it just never happens.  Then at the end of the period they vote against it.  And we're getting rid of many of these regulations.  (Applause.) You have to go through 17 agencies, many permits in each agency.In February alone, we added almost 60,000 new construction jobs in the country.  I ordered expedited environmental reviews for infrastructure, environmental and energy projects all across the country.  No longer will you have to wait year after year for approvals that never come.I also took historic action to lift the restrictions on American energy production and to put our miners, who have been treated horribly, back to work.  (Applause.)  They’re great people.  Consumer confidence is at its highest level in more than a decade.  You’ve seen all of the charts, all of the studies.  The National Association of Manufacturers just the other day reported the most optimism in the entire history of its survey -- which is a old survey -- 93 percent of manufacturers are optimistic about the future.  It was almost 27 percent lower than that just a few months ago.The Home Builders Confidence Index is at its highest level in 12 years.  And now in breaking news, it was just reported today, the monthly U.S. trade deficit declined by 10 percent -- for a reason.  Not by accident, believe me.  It was for a reason.We’re also going to protect your jobs by protecting our borders.  My administration is -- just a matter of weeks, literally, a short period of time -- has brought record reductions to illegal immigration.  Record reductions.  (Applause.)  Down 61 percent since inauguration.  General Kelly is doing a fantastic job.  And we’ll crack down on visa abuses that undermine the American worker.  And we're doing that right now.  (Applause.)These, and so many other great achievements, have defined our first 10 weeks in office.  We've done so much for the worker. Done so much for the military.  We've done so much for the police officers, our men in blue and women in blue who are not treated fairly.  We’re fighting for workers of all backgrounds and from all walks of life.  But to achieve true progress, we must remember our legacy.  We’re the nation that built the tallest skyscrapers on what was once the Hudson River, and put neon lights of Las Vegas in the middle of the desert.  But if government continues to punish America’s builders, then we will not be that nation any longer. I’m calling on all Americans -- Democrat, Republican, independent -- to come together and take part in the great rebuilding of our country.  (Applause.)  That is why, in my address to Congress, I called on lawmakers to pass legislation that produces a $1-trillion investment in the infrastructure of our country.  And we need it. (Applause.)  With your help, we can rebuild our country’s bridges, airports, seaports, and water systems.  We will streamline the process to get approvals quickly, so that long-delayed projects can finally move ahead.  And with lower taxes on America’s middle class and businesses, we will see a new surge of economic growth and development.All of you have come to the nation’s capital to call members of the House and Senate to action.  You’ve also called your President to action.  When you see them, you can tell Congress that America’s building trades and its President are very much united.  (Applause.)Together, we are ready to break new ground.  We will build in the spirit of one of the great projects in our nation’s history -- an enduring symbol of American strength.  The Empire State Building was forged in the Great Depression, and provided jobs for more than 3,000 workers.  We’ve all seen the pictures -- rugged workers perched dozens and dozens of stories up in the air.  Workers like these moved almost 60,000 tons of steel, installed 200,000 cubic feet of stone, and laid 10 million bricks to build that American icon.  And they did the job in a record time -- 13 months.  Hard to believe.  Think of that -- the Empire State Building built in 13 months, during the Depression. Nowadays, you couldn’t even get a building permit or approval in that amount of time. When the workers had secured the last piece of steel in that amazing and beautiful structure, they marked the moment -- as we still do today -- with what is called a “topping out” ceremony:  1.050 feet above the streets of New York City, they hoisted a beautiful and great American flag.  (Applause.)  AUDIENCE MEMBER:  The ironworkers!THE PRESIDENT:  They did a good job.  They did a good -- those ironworkers, you better believe it.  It was an American flag that represented American projects -- the big, bold, and daring dream of one man, and then one city, and then finally, one people.  That banner marked our nation’s proud climb to the top of the world.  Our people endured through the hardships of Depression and the battles of World War II, and they emerged from these trials stronger and more united than ever before.  Now, we must again summon that same national greatness to meet the challenges of our time.  Only miles from the halls of Congress and the newsrooms of Washington, you will find once-thriving cities marred by empty lots and once-booming industrial towns that have become rusted and are in total disrepair.  Standing before me today, in this very hall, are the men and women who, if given the chance, can transform these communities.  You are the citizens who can rebuild our cities, revive our industries, and renew our beloved country.  And I know you will stop at nothing to get the job done.  (Applause.)  For the rest of their lives, everyone who worked on the Empire State Building knew when they looked up at that great New York skyline that they had lifted the Stars and Stripes atop the tallest flagpole on Earth, and that somewhere high above the city streets, their place in history was carved into beams of steel.In the future, when we become -- the trials -- and we are -- trials of our times -- we too will emerge stronger and more united than ever before.  It’s happening, you watch.  When we rise above the cynics and critics who live only to defend the status quo, and to defend themselves from failure, then we, too, will construct a lasting monument to national greatness.In this future, our nation’s workers and craftsmen will look way out at the vast open landscape, and they will build new bridges and new schools and new landmarks, and they will proudly raise up for all to see our bright and beautiful American flag.  And when we see that flag, we will remember that we all share one American home, one American heart, and one American destiny.May God bless our nation’s builders.  May God bless our nation’s workers.  And may God bless the United States of America.  Thank yo
2017-03-31;https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/03/31/remarks-president-trump-et-al-signing-trade-executive-orders;Remarks by President Trump et al. at Signing of Trade Executive Orders;"During the campaign, I traveled the nation and visited the cities and towns devastated by unfair trade policies, probably one of the major reasons I'm here today -- trade.  Nobody has ever made bad trade deals like our country has made. I saw the shuttered factories and spent time with the laid-off factory workers.  I heard their stories, and I promised action and I promised them a solution.  And all over America, you're already seeing solutions start to take place.  Take a look at what's going on Michigan, with Ford and General Motors and Fiat-Chrysler, and so many more.  The jobs and wealth have been stripped from our country.  Year after year, decade after decade, trade deficit upon trade deficit -- reaching more than $700 billion last year alone, and lots of jobs.  Thousands of factories have been stolen from our country.  But these voiceless Americans now have a voice in the White House.  Under my administration, the theft of American prosperity will end.  We're going to defend our industry and create a level playing field for the American worker -- finally.Today, I am signing two executive orders that send this message loud and clear and that set the stage for a great revival of American manufacturing.  And you saw that today; you saw what happened, you saw the kind of numbers we have.  The survey actually showed 93 percent of manufacturers are now optimistic about the future -- a record high -- and that's up from about 56 percent just a couple of months ago.  We're going to build on that tremendous momentum.  We're bringing manufacturing and jobs back to our country.First, I'm signing an executive order to ensure that we fully collect all duties imposed on foreign importers that cheat.  They're cheaters.  From now on, those who break the rules will face the consequences -- and they'll be very severe consequences.Second, I am ordering the first-ever comprehensive review of America’s trade deficits and all violations of trade rules that harm the United States and the workers of the United States, just as I promised during my campaign.  This review will be led by Secretary Wilbur Ross, who is joining us here today.  Wilbur is an outstanding success story, an unbelievable businessman, a great but very, very fair negotiator, and on Wall Street he's simply known as Wilbur, and everybody knows him.  And now we have him on our side.  So I thank you, Wilbur.  You're going to do a fantastic job.We're going to investigate all trade abuses, and, based on those findings, we will take necessary and lawful action to end those many abuses.  I am not beholden to any political or financial interest.  I don’t care.  I'm here to do a job.  I'm doing a job for the American worker.  I really don’t care.  I'm not thinking about my business or anybody's business.  Wilbur isn't.  Peter isn’t.  None of the folks that we have up here are.  We're doing a job.  It's an opportunity like nobody has ever given.  And we're here to do a great job for the American worker and for our companies where the American workers are employed.I work for the American people.  Whether you're a Democrat, a Republican, or belong to no party at all, you are an American and I'm here to represent you and your family.  We're going to get this thing straightened out.  We're going to get these bad trade deals straightened out -- right, Peter?  It's time.  You've been looking at it for years -- right, Wilbur?  This combination over here, it can't be beaten.  That's why I defied the special interests and followed through on my pledge to withdraw immediately from the Trans-Pacific Partnership.  And that's why I am taking these very historic steps today.  The wellbeing of America and the American worker is my North Star.  And these two orders will point out our nation, and point to everybody, point to the world.  Next week, as you know, in Florida, the Southern White House, we're having the President of China and a large group from China as representatives.  And we're going to get down to some very serious business.  So we look forward to it.  I've spoken to him numerous times on the phone.  We look very much forward to it.  But it's been very bad what's been happening to our country in terms of our companies and in terms of our jobs.  So we're going to start turning it around.  We're going to turn it around fast; it's not going to take a long time.  It's going to go fast.  So I just want to end by saying that we have a team that's second to none.  And when everybody is assembled and fully in gear after these two orders, I think it's going to be something very special.  I'd like to ask Wilbur to say a few words, and then, Peter, you could say a few words.  And we're all set.  Our Vice President -- I think I'm speaking for both, but I'm not 100 percent sure.  I will tell you one thing -- he has one hell of a good marriage going.  (Laughter.)  Come on, Wilbur.SECRETARY ROSS:  Thank you, Mr. President.  If anyone had any doubt about the President's resolve to fix the trade problems, these two executive orders should end that speculation now and for all time.  This marks the beginning of a totally new chapter in the American trade relationship with our partners overseas.Thank you very much.THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  Peter.MR. NAVARRO:  I remember well during the campaign, the day the President made the speech outside of Pittsburgh and laid down a set of promises to the American people on trade.  And today, this is the beginning of the fulfillment of those promises in a grand way, with Wilbur Ross at the helm, and the President being the grand strategist of this.  And we're going to get it done for the American people, workers, and domestic manufacturers.  Thank you.THE PRESIDENT:  Mr. Vice President.THE VICE PRESIDENT:  This is a great day for the American worker and a great day for the American economy.  Once again President Trump is keeping his word.  As we look for ways to expand exports from this country, imports to this country, this President is determined that we're going to have free trade, but it's going to be fair trade, and arms-length negotiations with nations, holding them accountable to the promises that they make.  And the review the President is initiating today and the work of members of this team on the President's behalf will ensure that we put American first when it comes to trade; we put American jobs and American workers first.THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Mike.   Thank you, everybody.  You're going to see some very, very strong results very, very quic"
2017-03-31;https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/03/31/remarks-president-trump-listening-session-national-association;Remarks by President Trump in Listening Session with the National Association of Manufacturers;"We have some really good news today that's really fantastic -- these numbers.  Today I’m delighted to welcome the National Association of Manufacturers to the White House.  It’s a great group of people.  I know many of them well. And I want to thank your president and CEO, Jay Timmons, for being here with us today.  Great job.MR. TIMMONS:  Thank you. THE PRESIDENT:  Great job, Jay.  My administration is working every day to make it easier for manufacturers to build, hire, and grow in America.  We're removing job-killing regulations and lifting the burdens on American industry like I would say have never been lifted before. We've done a lot of work over the last 60, 70 days, and I think you're seeing some real production.I think we can say this, Mike -- like never before.Earlier this week, I signed an executive order to end the war on coal.  We had coal miners up at the office.  It was an amazing scene.  You had very tough, very strong, very powerful men that were crying actually; and they were crying with happiness.  And produce more American energy and more American jobs, which is how I got elected in the first place.We've created the task force in every agency to eliminate wasteful regulations.  And today at 3:30 p.m., with the Department of Commerce, Wilbur Ross, who will be up, and we're signing two very powerful executive orders.  That will be something very important -- very, very special.  And that will be with Commerce.One of the reasons we're here today is to announce the extraordinary results of a new survey from the National Association of Manufacturers.  Your survey shows that 93 percent of manufacturers now have a positive outlook on the future of their business in this country -- 93 [percent].  And it was just a few months ago, 56 [percent].  That's a slight difference.  (Laughter.)  That's a slight difference.  (Applause.)  That's a 20-year, record high -- highest it’s been in 20 years, and it’s going higher.  Believe me, you could come back next month, Jay.  (Laughter.)  I don’t know how much higher it can go.  And so I’m very proud of that, and we're all very proud of that.  And the manufacturers are really starting to invest big money, and a lot of things are happening.  It’s a new surge in optimism, which is sweeping all across our land.These survey results are a further vote of confidence in our plan to bring back jobs, lower taxes, and provide a level playing field for our workers.  The manufacturing companies represent -- and represented here today -- are just an extraordinary group of people.  They're leaders.  They're brilliant in so many ways.  The field has not been a level field.  Jobs have been leaving our country, going to China and Mexico and lots of other places.And you’ll be seeing what’s happening over the next few weeks.  It should be very interesting for you to watch.  As you know the President of China is coming to Florida.  We're having a meeting -- big meeting -- at Mar-a-Lago.  We call it the Southern White House, which it actually is.  It was originally built as the Southern White House, a lot of people don't know.  But it’s sort of strange how it got there.But it’s going to be something I think very important, very special.  I look very much forward to meeting him and the delegation, and we’ll see what happens.  But I am very, very proud of what you’ve been able to do in a short period of time -- just this little, short period of time, the optimism is so high. And I see the billions of dollars that are being invested by your people and your representatives in plant and equipment and jobs.And I appreciate that, Jay, very much.  Congratulations.  You may want to say a few words.MR. TIMMONS:  Well, I do.  And I want to reemphasize for the media here that this quarterly survey of our 14,000 members has been going on for 20 years.  And to the point you made, this was the highest level of optimism that our manufacturers have expressed in 20 years.THE PRESIDENT:  That's fantastic.MR. TIMMONS:  And the other statistic that I think you’ll find interesting is the right-track/wrong-track question that our manufacturers answered.  Just the month before Inauguration Day, the right-track number was only 26 percent.  Today it is over 60 percent.  So that's a huge growth, as well.  And that's because of the focus on taxes, regulations, infrastructure investment.  We appreciate your commitment to investment in job creation and manufacturing.  And we're going to deliver.THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much, Jay.  That's really nice.  MR. TIMMONS:  Thank you.  THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  Patricia, would you like to say something?  Pretty outstanding what you've done.MS. MILLER:  Thank you.  I appreciate being here today.  I own a plastics manufacturing company in the northwest suburbs of Chicago.  We're a three-year entrepreneurial in growth phase with a 40-year legacy.  It’s great to be part of manufacturing in the U.S. THE PRESIDENT:  That's a really great job.  You've done a great job.  Really great.Ed?MR. PARADOWSKI:  Good morning, Mr. President.  I’m Ed Paradowski, president of Apache Stainless Equipment.  We're in Beaver Dam, Wisconsin.  We manufacture capital equipment out of stainless steel and other high alloys.  We employ 175, and most of them are skilled trades people -- some of the best skilled trades people in the state of Wisconsin.  We are a 100 percent S Corp, and we would love to have you out in Beaver Dam, Wisconsin.THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I love the state of Wisconsin.  MR. PARADOWSKI:  As do I.THE PRESIDENT:  There was a little bit of an upset.  I don't think -- (laughter) -- I don't think -- I thought we were going to do very well there.  But people would -- they could consider that a slight upset, right?  But we don't consider it that.  Thank you.  Very good.Yes.  MR. STAUB:  Mr. President, good to see you again.  We enjoyed having you at our facility back in September.  I’m Steve Staub with Staub Manufacturing Solutions in Dayton, Ohio.THE PRESIDENT:  I remember. MR. STAUB:  And hopefully you got a chance to see the “First Day” video that we did with the National Association of Manufacturers.  THE PRESIDENT:  I did.  Thank you.  I did.  Great job.  And you've done a great job.MR. STAUB:  Thank you.  THE PRESIDENT:  Yes.MR. EDDY:  Good morning, Mr. President.  My name is Joe Eddy.  I’m the president and CEO of a company in northern West Virginia called Eagle Manufacturing.  We're 125 years old this year; a family-owned business.  We manufacture products out of steel and plastic.  We make over a thousand industrial safety and hazardous materials handling products.  And I bring from West Virginia a major thank you for the work you’ve done for coal.THE PRESIDENT:  Great state.  Great people.  Really.  We really opened it up.  Nobody thought it would happen that fast.  They thought maybe at the end of the four-year term, maybe I'd sign it -- no.  Nobody thought we were going to go that fast.  And the people appreciate it.  Julie.MS. COPELAND:  Good morning, Mr. President.  I am Julie Copeland.  I am CEO and co-owner with my sister of Arbill, a Philadelphia-based company that protects people in the workplace.

Obviously -- we're 45 miles from where you're sitting right now  -- we’d love for you to come visit us.THE PRESIDENT:  Okay, good.  Well, we're not finished yet, Drew.  A lot of other things are happening, including -- you haven't seen this in 25 years.  That's great.MR. RIORDAN:  Mr. President, good morning.  My name is Tom Riordan.  I'm the CEO of Neenah Enterprises.  We're a casting and forging operation in Wisconsin -- 145 years old.  First products were plowshares back in the Civil War.

And we really appreciate what you're doing to help facilitate in making that happen.THE PRESIDENT:  We have a lot of plants going up now in Michigan that were never going to be there if I -- if I didn’t win this election, those plants would never even think about going back.  They were gone.  We're you thinking about getting out?MR. MAGYARI:  I wouldn't abandon the United States under any circumstances.  But Michigan, we definitely have had a rough go, and the things that you're doing and a lot of initiatives are really bringing Michigan back.THE PRESIDENT:  Big progress in Michigan.MS.

What an amazing audience this is.  (Laughter.)  So many young faces that represent the future of leadership in our country.  So true.  Melania and I are deeply honored to join you.  And, Melania, thank you for being here.  (Applause.)  So as you know, Melania is a very highly accomplished woman and really an inspiration to so many.  And she is doing some great job.  In fact, I shouldn’t say this, but her poll numbers went through the roof last week.  (Laughter.)  What was that all about?  Through the roof.  (Applause.)  She has to give us the secret, Mike, right?  (Laughter.)  Anyway, I appreciate it very much.  My Cabinet is full of really incredible women leaders.  Administrator Linda McMahon, who has been a friend of mine for a long time -- (applause) -- long time.  She’s done an incredible job in business, by the way.  Administrator Seema Verma, Secretary Betsy DeVos, and, of course, my good friend from South Carolina who is a very tough competitor, I want to tell you -- Nikki Haley, Ambassador.  She is doing fantastically well.  (Applause.)  And we’re also joined, of course, by Florida Attorney General, highly respected, Pam Bondi.  So I want to thank you, Pam.  Thank you.  (Applause.)  Elaine Chao, our Secretary of Transportation, who’s a real expert.  She was Secretary of Labor, but she said, I really wanted to be Secretary of Transportation.  That’s a real expertise, and she’s doing incredibly.  She would have been here, but she’s celebrating the 50th anniversary of the Department of Transportation right now as we speak.  And we’re going to work on infrastructure and we’re going to put up one of the big and great infrastructure bills of all time.  (Applause.)  We’re going to get our infrastructure fixed in our country, and we’re going to rebuild our country, and that’s what we need.  Lots of jobs, also.  (Applause.)And I want to thank Ford -- you saw their big announcement yesterday.  And so many others are announcing tremendous numbers of jobs.  (Applause.)  They’re not leaving our country anymore, folks.  They’re not leaving; they’re staying and they’re building right here.So we really have these incredibly strong and dedicated leaders, and they’re with me and they’re with us.  And I’m very happy about it.  And I want to thank you as being representative, very much, of our group.  Thank you all very much.  Thank you.  (Applause.) And I’m so proud that the White House and our administration is filled with so many women of such incredible talent.  This week, as we conclude Women’s History Month, we honor a great woman of American history.  Since the very beginning, women have driven -- and I mean each generation of Americans -- toward a more free and more prosperous future.Among these patriots are women like the legendary Abigail Adams -- right? -- (applause) -- who, during the founding, urged her husband to remember the rights of women.  She was very much a pioneer in that way.  We’ve been blessed with courageous heroes like Harriet Tubman, who escaped slavery -- (applause) -- and went on to deliver hundreds of others to freedom, first on the Underground Railroad, and then as a spy for the Union Army.  She was very, very courageous, believe me.  (Applause.)  And we’ve had leaders like Susan B. Anthony -- have you heard of Susan B. Anthony? -- (laughter) -- I’m shocked that you’ve heard of her -- who dreamed of a much more equal and fair future, an America where women themselves, as she said, “helped to make laws and elect the lawmakers.”  And that’s what’s happening more and more.  Tough competition out there, I want to tell you.  From the untamed frontiers of the Western Plains to the skyscrapers of Manhattan, American women in every generation have shown extraordinary grit, courage, and devotion.  Our present generation stands on the shoulders of these titans -- and that’s what they were and are -- titans.  Only by enlisting the full potential of women in our society will we be truly able to -- you have not heard this expression before -- make America great again.  (Laughter and applause.)  It’s a good expression.  (Applause.) Thank you.  Thank you, everybody.  Thank you.  It’s been a lot of fun.  (Laughter.)  And we didn’t get that one from Madison Avenue, right?  (Laughter.) My administration will work every day to ensure that our economy is a place where women can work, succeed, and thrive like never before.  That includes fighting to make sure that all mothers and all families have access to affordable childcare.  (Applause.)  We want every daughter in America to grow up in a country where she can believe in herself, believe in her future, and follow her heart and realize her dreams.  (Applause.) And we want a country that celebrates family, that celebrates community, and that creates a safe and loving home for every child -- every child.  That’s what we want.  (Applause.) Earlier this year, I met with a remarkable group of leaders.  They were women entrepreneurs from all across the country.  They started their businesses from absolutely nothing, and today have grown them into successful enterprises that employ hundreds -- and in certain cases, even thousands -- of people.  Just think of what our country could achieve if we unleashed the power of women entrepreneurs nationwide.  Think of that.  (Applause.)  So, as a man, I stand before you as President.  But if I weren’t President, I wouldn’t be happy to hear that statement.  That would be a very scary statement to me because there’s no way we can compete with you.  (Laughter.)  So I would not be happy.  (Applause.)  Just wouldn’t be happy.  One of the business owners I met, Lisa Phillips, used to be homeless.  She now is the owner of an event-planning company, and she trains homeless youth in Baltimore for good-paying jobs.  Lisa had a message for all of us.  As she put it, ""This is a country of chances…if you're willing to work hard, you'll get the chance.""  And she means it, and she’s become very successful.  She’s terrific. Lisa is right -- but we have to fight to ensure that more people have the chance to succeed.  To do that, we must believe in each other, and we must dare to dream of a better, brighter, and more prosperous future for all of our citizens.  We have no choice.  That’s what we have to do.And to be honest, whether you’re a woman or whether you’re a man, you have that same dream:  You want to be able to dream.  You just have a big advantage over us.  (Laughter.)  You know why?  Right there.  (Applause.)  There’s a lot of truth to that, Mike, right?That's what I want for each and every one, and each and every one of our daughters and our granddaughters.  And I know, together, we will get there.  I want every young person in the audience today, and watching from home -- and they’re all over the place; those cameras are all over -- (laughter) -- to know that the future truly belongs to you.  We are Americans, and we will not stop until we have achieved our dreams.  I want to thank you very much for being here.  It’s my great honor, I will tell you, to be here.  In fact, Melania said, this is something I just have to be at.  She feels so strongly about it.  She feels so strongly about it.  (Applause.) So thank you, God bless you, and God bless Ameri"

(Applause.)  Thank you very much.  I guess they like what we're about to sign.  I knew they were going to like this one.  Well, thank you very much.  I very much appreciate it.  And thank you to our great Vice President, Mike Pence.I'm thrilled that everybody could be here with us today.  I want to give special thanks to Administrator Scott Pruitt, Secretary Ryan Zinke, and Secretary Rick Perry for your remarks.  I told Rick, I said, run it the way you ran Texas -- because this is going to be a great operation.  And he did a great job, and we're honored to have all three.  And I'm really honored to have our Vice President, because Mike Pence has been outstanding.  Hasn’t he been outstanding?  (Applause.)  Together, this group is going to do a truly great job for our country.  We have a very, very impressive group here to celebrate the start of a new era in American energy and production and job creation.  The action I'm taking today will eliminate federal overreach, restore economic freedom, and allow our companies and our workers to thrive, compete, and succeed on a level playing field for the first time in a long time, fellas.  It's been a long time.  I'm not just talking about eight years; we're talking about a lot longer than eight years.  You people know it maybe better than anybody.Thanks, as well, to the many distinguished members of Congress who have taken the time to be here.  I want to thank all of our industry leaders who are with us and who share our determination to create jobs in America, for Americans.  And, Shelley, thank you very much also.  I spotted you in the audience.  Thank you.  That is what this is all about:  bringing back our jobs, bringing back our dreams -- and making America wealthy again.I also want to thank the dedicated public servants who are with us this afternoon.  You're doing important work to protect our health and public resources.  So important.  Finally, I want to acknowledge the truly amazing people behind me on this stage: our incredible coal miners.  (Applause.)  We love our coal miners.  Great people.  Over the past two years, I've spent time with the miners all over America.  They told me about the struggles they've endured.  I actually, in one case, I went to a group of miners in West Virginia -- you remember, Shelley -- and I said, how about this:  Why don’t we get together, we'll go to another place, and you'll get another job; you won't mine anymore.  Do you like that idea?  They said, no, we don’t like that idea -- we love to mine, that's what we want to do.  I said, if that's what you want to do, that's what you're going to do.And I was very impressed.  They love the job.  That's what their job is.  I fully understand that.  I grew up in a real estate family, and until this recent little excursion into the world of politics, I could never understand anybody who would not want to be in the world of real estate.  (Laughter.)  Believe me.  So I understand it.  And we're with you 100 percent, and that's what you're going to do.  Okay?  (Applause.)  The miners told me about the attacks on their jobs and their livelihoods.  They told me about the efforts to shut down their mines, their communities, and their very way of life.  I made them this promise:  We will put our miners back to work.  (Applause.)  We've already eliminated a devastating anti-coal regulation -- but that was just the beginning.Today, I'm taking bold action to follow through on that promise.  My administration is putting an end to the war on coal.  We're going to have clean coal -- really clean coal.  With today’s executive action, I am taking historic steps to lift the restrictions on American energy, to reverse government intrusion, and to cancel job-killing regulations.  (Applause.)  And, by the way, regulations not only in this industry, but in every industry.  We're doing them by the thousands, every industry.  And we're going to have safety, we're going to have clean water, we're going to have clear air.  But so many are unnecessary, and so many are job killing.  We're getting rid of the bad ones.  One after another, we’re keeping our promises and putting power back into the hands of the people.  First, today’s energy independence action calls for an immediate reevaluation of the so-called Clean Power Plan.  (Applause.)  Perhaps no single regulation threatens our miners, energy workers, and companies more than this crushing attack on American industry.Second, we are lifting the ban on federal leasing for coal production.Third, we are lifting job-killing restrictions on the production of oil, natural gas, clean coal, and shale energy.  And finally, we are returning power to the states -- where that power belongs.  States and local communities know what is best for them.  They understand it.  They get it.  They’ve been doing it for a long time.  It was taken away from them, and not handled well -- and they are the ones that we should now, and will now, empower to decide.My action today is the latest in a series of steps to create American jobs and to grow American wealth.  We’re ending the theft of American prosperity, and rebuilding our beloved country.  We approved the permit to finally build the Keystone XL pipeline, and cleared the way to completion of the Dakota Access pipeline -- thousands and thousands of jobs.  (Applause.) We’ve already created a half a million new jobs in the first two jobs reports of my administration.  And if you noticed today, Ford -- great company -- announced massive new spending on three big plants in the state of Michigan -- a state which I love very much.  Do you remember what happened in Michigan?  Remember, November 8th.  Oh, that was an exciting Michigan evening.  And Ford just made that announcement.  That’s a great announcement.  It’s a very important announcement.  It means jobs, jobs, jobs.We are going to continue to expand energy production, and we will also create more jobs in infrastructure, trucking, and manufacturing.  This will allow the EPA to focus on its primary mission of protecting our air and protecting our water.  Together, we are going to start a new energy revolution -- one that celebrates American production on American soil.We want to make our goods here instead of shipping them in from other countries.  All over the world, they ship in, ship in -- take the Americans' money, take the money, go home; take our jobs, take our companies.  No longer, folks.  No longer.  We believe in those really magnificent words:  Made in the USA.  (Applause.)  Right, fellas?We will unlock job-producing natural gas, oil, and shale energy.  We will produce American coal to power American industry.  We will transport American energy through American pipelines, made with American steel.  Made with American steel.  Can you believe somebody would actually say that?  (Applause.) This came up a little bit coincidentally when I was signing the pipelines deals.  I’m all signing, I’ve got them done.  And I said, folks, where do we get the steel?  And they said, I think it’s from foreign lands.  And I said, no good.  Who makes it?  Who makes those beautiful pipes for the pipeline?  Sir, they’re made outside of this country.  I said, no more, no more.  So we added a little clause -- didn’t take much -- that you want to build pipelines in this country?  You’re going to buy your steel, and you’re going to have it fabricated here.  Makes sense, right?  Doesn’t it make sense, Bob?  Think so.  He knows.  (Applause.) Together, we will create millions of good American jobs -- also, so many energy jobs -- and really lead to unbelievable prosperity all throughout our country.  And Rick Perry is going to have a lot to do with that.I want to just thank everybody in this room.  You’re all very special people.  In particular, I want to thank the miners.  You know, my guys, they’ll get enough thanks.  These people haven’t had enough thanks.  They’ve had a hard time for a long time.  (Applause.)  They’re tough-looking guys, too.  I’ll tell you what -- not going to mess around with this group, right?  All right.  Thank you, fellas.  I made my promise and I keep my promise.So I want to thank everybody in the room.  God bless you, and God bless America.  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  (Applause.) THE PRESIDENT:  Come on, fellas.  Basically, you know what this is?  You know what it says, right?  You’re going back to work. PARTICIPANT:  Good.  (Applause.) THE PRESIDENT:  You’re going back to work.Ready?PARTICIPANT:  We’re ready.THE PRESIDENT:  Okay.  (Applause.)(The executive order is signed.)  Come on.  What about a miner?  One of the miners -- who’s the miner back there?  Only a miner.  (Laughter.)  Come on, fellas.  You split it up.  Cut it in -- (laughter) -- come on, where’s Ryan?  Where's Ryan?  Okay, Rick, you’ll split that up with Ryan.I want to thank everybody very much.  This is a great honor today.  Very special, special people.  And you're going to see a lot of progress.  And Shelley, thank you very much.  You have been fantastic.  Really fan"

Look at all the press.  Well, you’re the greatest people.  You keep us safe, right?PARTICIPANT:  Yes, sir.THE PRESIDENT:  You keep us safe.  It’s a tremendous honor to welcome the Fraternal Order of Police to the White House.  So many of you I know for so long, and you’ve been friends of mine, and you do a great job.  Nobody braver.  I want to thank your entire leadership team, including your national president, Chuck Canterbury.  I also want to thank you for your support during the election.  I guess you probably know, the numbers were extremely lopsided, right?  I’m just trying to figure out who were the few people that voted the other way.  Who are they?  (Laughter.)  Find out who they are, please, and let us know?As I traveled the country during my campaign, I had the great privilege to spend time with our amazing police officers who risk their lives every day to keep us safe.  And I made a crucial pledge:  We will always support -- and you people know that better than anybody, you know me -- the incredible men and women of law enforcement.  I will always have your back -- 100 percent, like you’ve always had mine, and you showed that on November 8th.   I’m also pleased to have with us our great Attorney General, Jeff Sessions.  Thank you, Jeff, for being here.  That was a big day you had yesterday too, on sanctuary cities.  ATTORNEY GENERAL SESSIONS:  Thank you.THE PRESIDENT:  That was a very, very important thing you did, and, frankly, a very popular thing.  So congratulations.And Jeff is with us -- a strong supporter of law enforcement -- you know that.  He was in Alabama.  He was the attorney general.  He was a U.S. attorney -- and a lot of people don’t know that.  They know him as the senator, but the law enforcement people knew him more even as the other.  So here to do a great job.  Good, Jeff.  Great to have you with us. Sadly, our police are often prevented from doing their jobs.  When policing is reduced, the main victims are the most vulnerable citizens of our society -- and you see that all over.  In too many of our communities, violent crime is on the rise, and in too many places, our citizens have not been safe for a very, very long time.  These are the painful realities many in Washington do not want to talk about.  They just don’t want to hear about it.  And we have seen that -- we’ve seen it all over.  By the way, who is from the standpoint of New York?  Where are my New York guys here?  PARTICIPANT:  No New York.THE PRESIDENT:  That’s terrible.  (Laughter.)  I have one sitting in my office.  He’s the greatest.  He’s coming right in. Last year, in Chicago, 4,368 people were shot.  Nearly 700 more have already been shot since January of this year alone.  I ask, what’s going on in Chicago, right?  What is going on there?  There’s no excuse for it.  There’s no excuse for it.  I’m sure you’re asking the same question:  What’s going on in Chicago?I also want to thank our Vice President for being with us.  Mike Pence has been amazing -- an amazing Vice President, and very much a believer in law enforcement and the job you people do.All of our citizens have the right to live in safety and peace.  We will work every day to remove the gang members, drug dealers, and violent criminals from your communities -- and we already are.  They’re being moved very quickly.  In fact, General Kelly, as you know, has done a fantastic job on the border.  Down 61 percent since inauguration.  People coming in down 61 percent, which is a tremendous number.My highest duty as President is the security of our people, the security of our nation.  That is why I’ve already taken numerous actions to enhance domestic security, including the creation of Task Force on Reducing Violent Crime, an interagency task force to dismantle criminal cartels, along with historic actions to secure our borders and remove criminals from our country.  We’re removing MS-13.  We’re removing criminals all over the country.  They’re getting out.  We’re taking them out.  And for that, I thank you folks.  I know you’re in strict coordination with General Kelly and the border patrol and ICE, and you’ve been doing a fantastic job.As President, I will work night and day to make America safe again.  And we’ve already done a big part of it.  You’ll see the numbers come out very soon.  I just want to thank all of you for your leadership.  I want to thank all of you for your expertise, the job you’ve done.  And it’s a great honor to be with you today.  And we’ll now go around and just introduce yourselves.  Introduce yourself in front of all this live television.  It’s always live for me.  You know, unfortunately, the other guys -- they make a speech and don’t -- with me, everything is live.  One mistake and it’s no good.  But we just can’t make mistakes, right?  So we don’t make mistakes.Go ahead.MR. CANTERBURY:  I’m Chuck Canterbury, the National President of Fraternal Order of Police, from South Carolina.MR. McDONALD:  I’m Jay McDonald.  I’m the Vice President of the National Fraternal Order of Police, and I’m from Ohio.MR. PENOZA:  I’m Tom Penoza.

2017-03-24;https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/03/24/remarks-president-trump-health-care-bill;Remarks by President Trump on the Health Care Bill;"Thank you very much.  We were very close, and it was a very, very tight margin.  We had no Democrat support.  We had no votes from the Democrats.  They weren’t going to give us a single vote, so it's a very difficult thing to do. I've been saying for the last year and a half that the best thing we can do politically speaking is let Obamacare explode.  It is exploding right now.  Many states have big problems -- almost all states have big problems.  I was in Tennessee the other day, and they’ve lost half of their state in terms of an insurer; they have no insurer.  And that's happened to many other places.  I was in Kentucky the other day, and similar things are happening.So Obamacare is exploding.  With no Democrat support, we couldn't quite get there.  We were just a very small number of votes short in terms of getting our bill passed.  A lot of people don't realize how good our bill was because they were viewing phase one.  But when you add phase two -- which was mostly the signings of Secretary Price, who's behind me -- and you add phase three, which I think we would have gotten -- it became a great bill.  Premiums would have gone down and it would have been very stable, it would have been very strong.  But that's okay.  But we're very, very close.  And again, I think what will happen is Obamacare, unfortunately, will explode.  It's going to have a very bad year.  Last year you had over a 100 percent increases in various places.  In Arizona, I understand it's going up very rapidly again, like it did last year; last year it was 116 percent.  Many places, 50, 60, 70 percent, I guess it averaged -- whatever the average was -- very, very high.   And this year should be much worse for Obamacare.So what would be really good, with no Democrat support, is if the Democrats, when it explodes -- which it will soon -- if they got together with us and got a real healthcare bill.  I would be totally up to do it.  And I think that's going to happen.  I think the losers are Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer, because now they own Obamacare.  They own it -- 100 percent own it.  And this is not a Republican healthcare, this is not anything but a Democrat healthcare.  And they have Obamacare for a little while longer, until it ceases to exist, which it will at some point in the near future.  And just remember this is not our bill, this is their bill.Now, when they all become civilized and get together, and try and work out a great healthcare bill for the people of this country, we're open to it.  We're totally open to it.  I want to thank the Republican Party.  I want to thank Paul Ryan -- he worked very, very hard, I will tell you that.  He worked very, very hard.  Tom Price and Mike Pence -- who’s right here -- our Vice President, our great Vice President.  Everybody worked hard.  I worked as a team player and would have loved to have seen it passed.  But again, I think you know I was very clear, I think there wasn’t a speech I made, or very few where I didn’t mention that perhaps the best thing that can happen is exactly what happened today, because we'll end up with a truly great healthcare bill in the future, after this mess known as Obamacare explodes.So I want to thank everybody for being here.  It will go very smoothly, I really believe.  I think this is something -- it certainly was an interesting period of time.  We all learned a lot.  We learned a lot about loyalty.  We learned a lot about the vote-getting process.  We learned a lot about some very arcane rules in, obviously, both the Senate and in the House.  So it's been -- certainly for me, it's been a very interesting experience.  But in the end, I think it's going to be an experience that leads to an even better healthcare plan.  So thank you all very much.  And I'll see you soon.Q    Mr. President, is it now your intention to go for tax reform?  Or what’s next on your priority list?THE PRESIDENT:  We'll be going right now for tax reform, which we could have done earlier, but this really would have worked out better if we could have had some Democrat support.  Remember this:  We had no Democrat support.  So now we're going to go for tax reform, which I've always liked.Q    And you're confident in Speaker Ryan's leadership and his ability to get things done?THE PRESIDENT:  Yes, I am.  I like Speaker Ryan.  He worked very, very hard.  A lot of different groups, he's got a lot of factions.  And there's been a long history of liking and disliking, even within the Republican Party, long before I got here.  But I've had a great relationship with the Republican Party.  It seems that both sides like Trump, and that's good.  And you see that, I guess, more clearly than anybody.But we've had a -- I'm not going to speak badly about anybody within the party.  But certainly there's a big history.  I think Paul really worked hard.  And I would say that we will probably start going very, very strong for the big tax cuts and tax reform.  That will be next.Q    Sir, is it fair to Americans to let Obamacare explode?THE PRESIDENT:  Well, it's going to happen.  There's not much you can do about it.  It's going to -- bad things are going to happen to Obamacare.  There's not much you can do to help it.  I've been saying that for a year and a half.  I said, look, eventually it's not sustainable.  The insurance companies are leaving -- you know that.  They're leaving one by one, as quick as you can leave.  And you have states, in some cases, who will not be covered.  So there's no way out of that.But the one thing that was happening, as we got closer and closer, everybody was talking about how wonderful it was, and now we'll go back to real life and people will see how bad it is.  And it's getting much worse.  You know, I said the other day, when President Obama left -- '17, he knew he wasn’t going to be here; '17 is going to be a very, very bad year for Obamacare.  Very, very bad.  You're going to have explosive premium increases.  And the deductibles are so high people don’t even get to use it.So they'll go with that for a little while.  And I honestly believe -- I know some of the Democrats, and they're good people -- I honestly believe the Democrats will come to us and say, look, let's get together and get a great healthcare bill or plan that's really great for the people of our country.  And I think that's going to happen.Q    If you could have passed the bill in the House without any Democratic support, why do you think you weren’t able to craft a deal among the Republican Party?THE PRESIDENT:  Well, we were very close.  We were just probably anywhere from 10 to 15 votes short.  Could have even been closer than that.  You'll never know because you'll never know how they vote.  But in the end, I think we would have been 10 votes, maybe closer.  And it was very hard to get almost 100 percent.  You're talking about a very, very large number of votes -- among any group.  And we were very close to doing it.  But when you get no votes from the other side -- meaning the Democrats -- it's really a difficult situation.Q    Will you reach out to the Democrats now?THE PRESIDENT:  No, I think we have to let Obamacare go its way for a little while, and we'll see how things go.  I'd love to see it do well, but it can't.  I mean, it can't.  It's not a question of, gee -- I hope it does well.  I would love it to do well.  I want great healthcare for the people of this nation.  But it can't do well.  It's imploding, and soon will explode, and it's not going to be pretty.So the Democrats don’t want to see that, so they're going to reach out when they're ready.  And whenever they're ready, we're ready.Q    Do you feel betrayed by the House Freedom Caucus at all?  They seemed to be the most difficult to get.THE PRESIDENT:  No, I'm not betrayed.  They're friends of mine.  I'm disappointed because we could have had it.  So I'm disappointed.  I'm a little surprised, to be honest with you.  We really had it.  It was pretty much there within grasp.  But I'll tell you what's going to come out of it is a better bill -- I really believe a better bill.  Because there were things in this bill I didn’t particularly love.  And I think it's a better bill.  You know, both parties can get together and do real healthcare.  That's the best thing.  Obamacare was rammed down everyone's throat -- 100 percent Democrat.  And I think having bipartisan would be a big, big improvement.  So, no, I think that this is going to end up being a very good thing.  I'm disappointed, but they're friends of mine, and they got -- this is a very hard time for them and a very hard vote.  But they're very good people.Q    You mentioned that there were things in this bill that you didn’t necessarily love.  What specifically are those?THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I think we could have things that I would have liked more.  And if we had bipartisan, I really think we could have a healthcare bill that would be the ultimate.  And I think the Democrats know that also.  And some day, in the not--too-distant future, that will happen.  And I never said -- I guess I'm here, what, 64 days?  I never said repeal and replace Obamacare -- you've all heard my speeches -- I never said repeal it and replace it within 64 days.  I have a long time.  But I want to have a great healthcare bill and plan -- and we will.  It will happen.  And it won't be in the very distant future.  I really believe there will be some Democrat support, and that will happen, and it will be an even better bill.  I think this was a very good bill.  I think it will be even better the next time around.  I don’t think that's going to be in too long a period of time.Q    Anything specifically you want to see changed going from this bill to the next bill?THE PRESIDENT:  No, I mean, I don’t want to speak about specifics, but there are things I could have -- I would have liked even more.  But I feel overall this was a very, very good bill.  And I thought Tom Price -- Dr. Tom Price -- who really is amazing on healthcare, his knowledge -- I thought he did a fantastic job.  Same with Mike Pence.  I think these two guys -- they worked so hard and really did "

I said, make sure that microphone is absolutely perfect, George.  He never lets me -- the Director of White House Advance.  And George Sifakis -- (applause) -- where's George?  And these guys are with me right from the beginning -- the Director of the Office of Public Liaison.  It's a great team.  It's a great, great team.  Can't do any better.They helped organize this wonderful event with the Greek Archdiocese of America and so many local parishioners.  And I want to thank you all.  You're here, you're all over the audience.  I want to thank you all.Your Eminence and Father Alex, it is a true privilege to host you at the White House.  I was deeply honored to have you both at my inauguration -- it was a great day -- and I am grateful for your presence here today.  I also want to thank you for awarding Reince and George the highest honor of the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America -- the Medal of Saint Paul. To everyone in the youth choir who just performed -- they were beautiful.  (Applause.)  I heard that music.  I heard that music.   With such elegance and grace, you're amazing -- you really are.  Beautiful, beautiful sounds.  I know you made your parents very proud.  And you make all of us proud, right?Today we commemorate an event that we have marked with a national day of celebration for 30 years:  Greek Independence Day.  Very important.  President Ronald Reagan started this wonderful tradition, and we are thrilled to continue it, and always will.  Greek Independence Day celebrates the rebirth of liberty for the Greek people.  It commemorates the fight for the Greek Independence that began on March 25th, 1821.  After nearly 400 years of outside rule, the Greeks longed to regain their sovereignty.This love of freedom and democracy has formed a lasting bond between our two countries.  It is a bond that has its origins in Ancient Greece -- “the birthplace of Democracy.”American President James Monroe and the great American statesman Daniel Webster both supported Greece’s struggle for independence.  And it was a tough, tough struggle, you know that.  Then-Representative Webster honored the role of Greece in forming civilization, and said that “We, like the rest of mankind, are greatly her debtors.”In years to come, we don’t know what will be required to defend our freedom, but we do know that it will demand great, great courage -- a courage from all of us -- and we will show it, and I have no doubt about that.Drawing inspiration from our history and those who come before, we will rise to any occasion.  We have a country that, as you know, has certain difficulties, has certain problems.  We will solve those problems and we will quickly solve those difficulties.  Just watch.  (Applause.)  I want to thank you all for coming to the White House today.  We celebrate Greek history, and we applaud the tremendous contributions of your people to our beloved country.  May God bless you all.  And with that, I would like to recognize His Emin
2017-03-24;https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/03/24/remarks-president-trump-jobs-announcement-charter-communications;Remarks by President Trump at Jobs  Announcement with Charter Communications;Thank you very much.  We greatly appreciate you being here.  I’m delighted to welcome Tom Rutledge, Chairman and CEO of Charter Communications -- a great company -- to the White House.  I'm also very honored that my friend, Texas Governor Greg Abbott -- my good friend and supporter -- we love you -- is here with us today.  Very appropriate.  He’s done a fantastic job in Texas, and we had a previous governor who did a very good job, right?  GOVERNOR ABBOTT:  Right.  (Laughter.)  THE PRESIDENT:  Right.  He’s around here someplace.  Standing right over there.I'm very excited about the announcement we are about to make.  First, some background.Five years ago Charter Communications was a struggling company that had slowly emerged from bankruptcy.  Today, thanks to hard work and unbelievable leadership, truly great leadership, it’s the fastest-growing television, Internet, and voice company in the nation.  I would say that's a good job.  Not bad.  Tom Rutledge and his team turned the company around, and they did it very quickly.  They created a culture of customer service and excellence.  And, most importantly, they brought back many jobs that had been shipped overseas -- something that's happening far too often, but we're changing that.  That is very good for certain businesses but not good for the United States, not good for America, not good for our people.When American workers win, America as a country wins.  We want to have companies that thrive and hire and grow right here in America.  And we want them to use American workers and American citizens.Today I am thrilled to announce that Charter Communications has just committed to investing $25 billion -- with a B, $25 billion -- you're sure that's right, right?  (Laughter.)  With a B, right -- $25 billion here in the United States, and has committed further to hiring 20,000 American workers over the next four years.  Charter has also committed to completely end its offshore call centers -- that is such a big deal -- and to base 100 percent of its call centers here in the United States -- all American jobs.  This is great for their workers, it’s great for the customers, and it's certainly great for the United States.  And you watch, it will be one of your really fantastic decisions. Tom will be opening a brand new beautiful call center in McAllen, Texas -- you know McAllen, right, good place?GOVERNOR Abbott:  Great place.THE PRESIDENT:  I knew you would say that -- (laughter) -- where they will create 600 new American jobs.  Charter’s announcement follows a number of American businesses -- from Exxon to Intel to Lockheed to Boeing to many others -- that have recently announced billions of dollars in investment and thousands of jobs coming into the United States following my election victory.  And by the way, thank you for your support.  The Governor was a great supporter -- a great supporter.  I want to thank you for -- you’ve done a fantastic job.We're embracing a new economic model -- the American Model. We’re going to massively eliminate job-killing regulations -- that has started already, big league -- reduce government burdens, and lower taxes that are crushing American businesses and American workers all over this country.  And we are really in the process of announcements and you’re going to see thousands and thousands and thousands of jobs, of companies, and everything coming back into our country.  And they’re coming in far faster than even I had projected. So we're honored.  I'd like to have Tom Rutledge say a few words about what he’s doing and about his great company.  And after that, you guys can go back to healthcare.  (Laughter.)   MR. RUTLEDGE:  Thank you, Mr. President.  You know, it’s a great pleasure to announce these jobs.  And Charter has been insourcing jobs for the last five years, and as a result of that, our company has performed tremendously.  Using high-skilled, high-quality workers actually saves money.  It saves money.  As you know as a builder, if you do the job right the first time, it’s a lot less expensive than redoing it.  And we found that in the service business, and we found that we can actually do better with high-quality, high-skilled American workers.  And so we’ve been doing that, and our company was so successful that we were able to recently do a huge transaction with Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks, and put together this tremendous company.  And as part of that, we’re going to insource all the calls that Time Warner Cable outsourced -- 50 percent of their calls were leaving the country.  So we’re going to bring all that back, and create 20,000 new jobs.  And we’re very excited about that.And we’re also excited about the opportunity, in the right regulatory climate and right tax climate, to make major infrastructure investments.  And we’re going to spend $25 billion.  We’re committed to spending that predicated on the kind of regulatory consistency and efficiency that we expect as a country.  And so we’re looking forward to the opportunity to create these jobs and to build this infrastructure.And Kip Mayo, who manages our call centers, would like to tell you what we’re going to do in the McAllen specifically.MS. MAYO:  So with the opening of the McAllen center, it gives us the capacity to be able to create over 600 good-paying jobs.  That allows us to insource work that is currently performed through third parties.The McAllen center will be our first fully bilingual call center.  It will allow customers who prefer to communicate with us in Spanish to do so, and we will provide them with service and technical support.  We have already hired a general manager -- very qualified woman who is bilingual, and is also, coincidentally, a native McAllen.  We expect to open the call center next month, and we’ve hired over 100 employees already, and they will be trained and they will be ready to assist our customers in just a few short weeks.So this is a very big step for us in our strategy and our plans over the course of the next few years to create jobs and to bring work in from overseas and back to the United States.MR. RUTLEDGE:  And they’re good jobs, too.  And they’re high-paid jobs.  They have pensions.  They have healthcare. They’re the kind of jobs people want -- they’re good, solid middle-class jobs, and we’re proud to make them available.THE PRESIDENT:  That’s great.  Thank you very much, Tom.  Fantastic job with the company.  Unbelievable job.I’d like to just close it out by asking my friend, Governor Greg Abbott to say a few words, and he’ll talk about the company. But he’s very proud of what they’ve been doing in Texas.  So am I.  So, Greg.GOVERNOR ABBOTT:  Sure.  Well, first, I’m proud of you.  We have a President who’s living up to his campaign promise, and that is to create more jobs, but also to create more jobs by returning jobs from overseas back to the United States.I want to thank Charter Communications for the great job you’re doing, but also for expanding, in the great state of Texas.  We’re happy that this first tranche of your expansion is in the Rio Grande Valley, in McAllen, Texas.  You talked about the tax environment, the regulatory environment.  Texas is number one in the nation for job creation because of the pro-business climate that we have because we have the right workforce to take care of the needs of companies like Charter Communications.So this is a win-win.  It’s a win for the President.  It’s a win for Charter.  It’s a win for the great state of Texas.  The country is better today because of the jobs that will be created tomorrow in McAllen, Texas.THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  Thanks, Greg.  GOVERNOR ABBOTT:  Thank you, President.THE PRESIDENT:  Thank 
2017-03-22;https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/03/22/remarks-president-trump-meeting-members-congressional-black-caucus;Remarks by President Trump Before Meeting with Members of the Congressional Black Caucus;Well, I’m deeply honored to welcome the members of the Congressional Black Caucus to the White House.  We’re going to have a lot of meetings over the years, and I very much appreciate you being here.Throughout my campaign, I pledged to focus on improving conditions for African American citizens.  This means more to me than anybody would understand or know.  Every American child has a right to grow up in a safe community, to attend great schools, to graduate with access to high-paying jobs.  America has spent trillions and trillions of dollars overseas.  I guess -- I heard just recently in the Middle East we’ve spent as of about two months ago $6 trillion -- $6 trillion, and you know where we are over there -- while neglecting the fate of American children in cities like Baltimore and Chicago and Detroit.  African American citizens have given so much to this country.  They’ve fought in every war since the Revolution, and they’ve fought hard.  They’ve lifted up the conscience of our nation in the march toward civil rights, enriched the soul of America -- and their faith and courage.  And they’ve advanced our country in the fields of science, arts and medicine.Elijah Cummings, who was here about two weeks ago, who I happen to think is a terrific man -- I don’t know if he’ll say that about me, but I will tell you, I really liked him a lot.  And we were talking about drugs and prescription drugs and the costs.  And you go to Europe, you go to Canada, you go to other countries and you buy them for a fraction of what you pay in this country.  And that’s been a very big subject for him, and it’s a subject for me that is very important.  And we’re going to either do it in healthcare -- which I think we’re going to do it in healthcare -- or we’re going to do it separately. But we’re going to bid on drug prices, and we’re going to try and have the lowest prices anywhere in the world, from really the highest.  And that’s not only the drugs, it’s prescription drugs.  But you go out to stores and you go even -- in any community, rich or poor community, and you look at the kind of drug prices that we’re paying and it’s really unfair what’s happened in our country.So we’re going to be instituting a very, very strong bidding process.  We’ll probably need some legislation, but we’re going to do it regardless.  We have to do it.  And we’re going to get drug prices way down, way down.  Some people think it’s as important as the healthcare measure, because people are being ripped off when they need their -- they need drugs, they need prescription drugs.  And we’re going to take care of that situation.So again, I very much appreciate you being here.  It’s a tremendous honor for me.  And we’re going to work on different things, and we’re going to see if we can get a lot accomplished.And with that, let’s get 
2017-03-20;https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/03/20/remarks-president-trump-bilateral-meeting-prime-minister-al-abadi-iraq;Remarks by President Trump in a Bilateral Meeting with Prime Minister al-Abadi of Iraq;  Mr. Prime Minister, it’s an honor to have you here before our Cabinet, which I hope in years to come will be thought of one the great Cabinets in the history of the United States.  We just spent a few minutes speaking in the Oval Office and learning and giving each other ideas.  One of the things I did ask is why did President Obama sign that agreement with Iran, because nobody has been able to figure that one out.  But maybe someday we’ll be able to figure it out.I want to thank you very much for being here, great respect for you.  I know you're working very hard, and General Mattis and General McMaster and Rex Tillerson have all been telling me that you're doing a job -- it’s not an easy job, it’s a very tough job.  Your soldiers are fighting hard.  I know Mosul is moving along, but Mosul was ours until we left.  So perhaps we shouldn’t have gone in, and certainly we shouldn’t have left.  We should never ever have left, and the vacuum was created, and we discussed what happened.  But we’ll spend a lot of time with you, with your group.  And thank you all very much for being here.  We appreciate it.  And we will figure something out.  Our main thrust is we have to get rid of ISIS.  We're going to get rid of ISIS.  It will happen.  It’s happening right now.  General Mattis and his team have done an incredible job.  A lot of things are different than they were even five or six weeks ago.  We've been here a short while and people have said they’d never seen such a difference.So we are with you.  And again, thank you very much for being with us.PRIME MINISTER AL-ABADI:  Excuse me a second.PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Yes, please.PRIME MINISTER AL-ABADI:  (Speaks Arabic.)

It is truly great to be back here in Michigan -- great.  (Applause.)  And it’s also wonderful to be here with the leaders, workers, engineers and suppliers of Ford, and Fiat-Chrysler, and General Motors, and many others.  We have so many leaders that we just met, all of the leaders of the major car companies and really the automobile business.  It's a great business, it's a wonderful business, but it's been pretty much hurt here.  But it's not going to be hurt for long, that I can tell you.  (Applause.)  That I can tell you.  I'm sure you've all heard the big news that we're going to work on the CAFE standards, so you can make cars in America again.  (Applause.)  We're going to help the companies, and they're going to help you.  There is no more beautiful sight than an American-made car.  No more beautiful sight.  (Applause.)  I love this state, I love the people of this state.  And you did me a big favor, because you gave me a victory, and that victory hasn’t been won by a Republican in a long time -- long time.  (Applause.)  And you're going to be very happy, believe me.  You're going to be very, very happy.  During the campaign, I came to Michigan again and again, and I made this promise, that I am going to fight for your jobs and fight very, very hard.  (Applause.)  I'm going to fight for Michigan workers.  I'm going to fight to keep the automobile production in the United States of America, not outside -- in the United States.  (Applause.)  And, by the way, for those that have any doubts, many other industries do.  That's okay, right?  So we're here not simply to honor the past, but to devote ourselves to a new future of American automotive leadership.  We want to be the car capital of the world again.  We will be.  And it won't be long, believe me.  (Applause.)  And, by the way, we're going to have a very big announcement next week having to do with your industry.  Very, very big.  Very important.  Everybody is saying, ""what is it?""  Let's keep them guessing back there.  (Laughter.)    You’ve heard me say the words, and I’ll repeat them, right now:  Buy American and Hire American.  (Applause.)  It’s not just a motto, it’s a pledge.  It’s a pledge to the working people of this country.  The era of economic surrender for the United States is over -- it's over.  And you see what's already been happening:  plants are coming back; other plants that were expected to be built in other countries are not being built.  I just want to tell the leaders they made some very wise decisions.  Very wise.  Very wise.  (Applause.)  Some plants that were announced, they're not going to be built.  They're smart.We're going to stand up to foreign cheating.  We're going to crack down on currency manipulation.  And, yes, we're going to use the full economic powers of our country to protect our workers and to protect our jobs.  Let me also say how important it is for me that we have every segment of this great American industry represented in our audience today.  We have everybody.  To succeed as a country, we have to work together.  We have to fight, side-by-side, to protect our industry and to stop the jobs from leaving our country.  It's not going to happen anymore, folks.  We've gone through it for many, many years, decades.  It's not going to happen anymore.  And if it is, there's consequences to pay for the companies that desert us and fire our employees.  There are consequences.  (Applause.)  Already, we’re seeing jobs coming back.  Since my election, Ford has announced 700 new jobs coming back to their plant in Flat Rock, Michigan.  (Applause.)  Fiat-Chrysler has announced that they will create 2,000 new jobs in Michigan and Ohio.  (Applause.)  And just today -- breaking news -- General Motors announced that they're adding or keeping 900 jobs right here in Michigan, and that's going to be over the next 12 months.  And that's just the beginning, folks.  In fact, I told them, that's peanuts -- that's peanuts.  (Applause.)  We're going to have a lot more.  They're going to be building new plants, expanding their plants.My administration will work tirelessly to eliminate the industry-killing regulations, to lower the job-crushing taxes, and to ensure a level playing field for all American companies and workers.  Before NAFTA went into effect -- by the way, NAFTA, a total disaster -- there were 280,000 autoworkers in Michigan.  Today, that number is roughly 165,000 -- and would have been heading down big league if I didn’t get elected, I will tell you that right now.  That I can tell you.  (Applause.)  Plenty of things were stopped in their tracks.  They were stopped in their tracks.  A lot of bad things were going to happen.  A lot of places were going to get built that aren’t going to get built right now in other locations.  The number of auto plants in the state has been cut by a third.  Motor City once set the standard of living for the nation.  Now it has suffered under decades of failed economic decisions that have stripped our country of its jobs and of its wealth.  The Trans-Pacific Partnership -- another disaster -- threatened states like Michigan, Wisconsin, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and so many others with the loss of countless more jobs.  That is why I'm proud to say I followed through on my promise -- and, by the way, many other promises.  You’ve seen what’s happened.  Many.  (Applause.)  And immediately withdrew the United States from the TPP.  I kept my word.  The assault on the American auto industry, believe me, is over.  It’s over.  (Applause.)  Not going to happen anymore.We are setting up a task force in every federal agency to identify and remove any regulation that undermines American auto production and any other kind of production, including the production of high-end, low-end, big, small, every form of automobile and truck.  During my first week in office, I brought American auto companies to the White House.  Mary Barra is here.  Mark Fields is here.  Sergio is here, and others.  And none of them ever got to see the Oval Office before, because nobody took them into the Oval Office -- our Presidents.  They employ tens of thousands of people, but I brought them into the Oval Office because they’re going to be expanding their companies.  (Applause.)  But they all told me the same thing.  They explained that the previous administration promised you a so-called “mid-term review” of the federal fuel efficiency standards.  It was necessary because the standards were set far into the future -- way, way into the future.  If the standards threatened auto jobs, then commonsense changes could have and should have been made. Just days before my inauguration, the previous administration cut short the promised mid-term review in an 11th-hour executive action.  Today, I am announcing that we are going to cancel that executive action.  (Applause.)  We are going to restore the originally scheduled mid-term review, and we are going to ensure that any regulations we have protect and defend your jobs, your factories.  We’re going to be fair.  We’re going to be fair.This is an issue of deep importance to me.  For decades, I have raised the alarm over unfair foreign trade practices that have robbed communities of their wealth and robbed our people of their ability to provide for their families.  They’ve stolen our jobs, they’ve stolen our companies, and our politicians sat back and watched, hopeless.  Not anymore.As a private citizen, I looked, really with sadness, as massive shipments of foreign cars have been dumped onto our shores while those same countries have shut their borders to our cars.  We take them -- ""Come on in, folks.  Come on in.  No tax.  Don’t worry about it.""  We make cars; they don’t take us.  Not anymore.  (Applause.) Since NAFTA was approved, we’ve lost nearly one-third of our manufacturing jobs in the United States.  Since China entered the World Trade Organization, we’ve lost 60,000 factories.  Hard to believe.  Our trade deficit last year reached nearly $800 billion.  Who’s making these deals?  I can take anybody in the audience -- you’ll do better, believe me.  (Laughter.)  These statistics really should have shaken up Washington to do action, but nothing happened.  But something did happen -- happened on November 8th.  Believe me, it happened.  It happened for you.  (Applause.)  But the politicians made excuses.  They have said these chronic trade deficits have helped us to win friends abroad.  I don’t want friends abroad if that’s what it’s going to take.  We don’t need friends abroad for that.  Do you ever see that, where they said, ""No, no, it’s good for us because people like us abroad""?  They don’t like us -- they think we’re stupid people.  (Laughter.)  But no friendship is strengthened through economic abuse -- because we have been abused.  And no country can long lead the free world if it does not protect its industries and care for its people and protect its borders.  (Applause.)  America will be respected again, and you, as workers, will be respected again.  Believe me, you will be respected again.  Soon.  Now.  I think it’s already happened.Our great Presidents, from Washington to Jefferson to Jackson to Lincoln, all understood that a great nation must protect its manufacturing, must protect itself from the outside.  Today, I will be visiting the home of Andrew Jackson on the 250th anniversary of his birth.  And they say my election was most similar to his -- 1828.  That's a long time ago.  Usually they go back like to this one, or that one, 12 years ago, 16.  I mean, 1828, that's a long way.  That's a long time ago.In supporting tariffs, Jackson said, “I look at the tariff with an eye to the proper distribution of labor, and to revenue, and with a view to discharge our national debt.”  We owe $20 trillion -- $20 trillion with our policies.  America cannot be a wealthy country if special interests game the system to profit from the exodus of our companies and from the exodus of our jobs. We must embrace a new economic model.  Let’s call it ""The American Model.""   (Applause.) Under this system, we will reduce burdens on our companies and on our businesses.  But, in exchange, companies must hire and grow in America.  They have to hire and grow in our country.  That is how we will succeed and grow together -- American workers and American industry side-by-side.  Nobody can beat us, folks.  Nobody can beat us.  (Applause.)  Because whether we are rich or poor, young or old, black or brown or white, we all bleed the same red blood of patriots.  (Applause.)Great Americans of all backgrounds built the Arsenal of Democracy -- including the legendary Rosie the Riveter, who worked here at Willow Run.  You know that.  (Applause.)  Seventy-five years ago, during the Second World War, thousands of American workers filled this very building to build the great new airplanes -- the B-24 Liberator.  At peak production -- listen to this -- it’s not the country that we've been watching over the last 20 years -- they were building one B-24 every single hour.  (Applause.)   We don't hear that.  We don't hear that anymore, do we?  We’ll be back.  We’ll be back soon.  Most amazing people. And while that’s incredible, it’s a tribute really to the teamwork, determination, and patriotism that lives on today in each and every one of you.  Great people.  You're great people.  Now, these hundreds of acres that defended our democracy are going to help build the cars and cities of the future.  (Applause.)  So I ask you -- that's fine because you're right -- (laughter) -- so I ask you today to join me in daring to believe that this facility, this city, and this nation will once again shine with industrial might.  (Applause.)  I am asking you to place your faith in the American worker and these great American companies.  (Applause.)  I’m also asking you to respect and place your faith in companies from foreign lands that come here to build their product.  We love them too, right?  We love them too.  (Applause.)I’m asking all of the companies here today to join us in this new Industrial Revolution.  Let us put American workers, American families, and American dreams first once again.May God bless the American worker.  May God bless the Motor City.  And may God bless the United States of America.  Thank yo"
2017-03-13;https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/03/13/remarks-president-trump-first-cabinet-meeting;Remarks by President Trump in First Cabinet Meeting;"Hello, everybody.  I’m proud to welcome everyone to our first official Cabinet meeting.  I want to begin by updating the public on the severe weather situation.  I’ve been receiving the latest information on the blizzard forecast, and I think we're in very good shape.  We're prepared -- everybody in government is fully prepared and ready.   And the entire Northeast, it seems, is under a very severe winter storm warning.  So let’s hope it’s not going to be as bad as some people are predicting.  Usually it isn’t. Chancellor Merkel and I have just spoken, and she’s going to be postponing the trip until Friday.  She’ll be coming on Friday, and we look forward to that.  It will be a very good visit.  I’ve spoken with my Homeland Security Advisor.  He’s spoken with the acting FEMA Administrator, instructed him to make certain that the federal government is ready to provide assistance to the states that need federal help.  FEMA and the federal government are ready to assist.  They are literally waiting by the phones and ready to go.  Everyone should listen to their state and local officials who will be providing regular storm updates.  We take that advice very seriously.  This Cabinet is here to serve and protect the American people, and that's what we're doing -- even more so than anybody would understand.  The folks in this room have done an amazing job, whether it’s security or anything else.  I want to thank General Mattis, who is now Secretary Mattis.  I want to thank General Kelly, who is now Secretary Kelly.  They've done outstanding work.  You see what’s happening.  All you have to do is just watch.  Big difference.Unfortunately, not all of our Cabinet members could join us.  We have four empty seats -- which is a terrible thing -- because the Senate Democrats are continuing to obstruct the confirmation of our nominees for the Department of Labor, the Department of Agriculture, the Director of National Intelligence, and the United States Trade Representative, somebody I want very badly.  We're in the midst of getting going, Wilbur, and they won’t approve somebody who is highly qualified, and everybody understands that.  The main victim of this very partisan obstruction is the American public.Yet in spite of all of this, we've assembled a great team and already made historic progress in delivering results.  We're rolling back job-crushing regulations at a faster clip than ever before by far; and we're seeing companies like Exxon, Walmart, Intel, Ford, Fiat Chrysler, and so many others announcing that they will keep and create tens of thousands of jobs in the United States.  Many, many companies are not moving now, which normally they would have been out of here a long time ago.  They're not moving because they understand there are going to be consequences.  If they move, that's fine, but there will be consequences.  It’s not going to be so easy.  They're not going to fire our people and move and think they're going to ship their jobs back here and we won’t be doing anything about it.The first two job reports that have come out since my inauguration, we've already added nearly half a million new jobs.  Right after this meeting, we’ll be signing a new executive order to begin the process of reorganizing the executive branch to make it less wasteful and more productive.  We're also working closely with the House and Senate Republicans to repeal and replace Obamacare.  Obamacare, all of a sudden, the last couple of weeks is getting a false rep that maybe it’s okay.  It’s not okay; it’s a disaster -- and people understand that.  It’s failed and it’s imploding.  And if we let it go for another year, it will totally implode.  In fact, I’ve told the Republicans, why don't you just let it go for another year, that way everybody will really understand how bad it is.  But it would be the wrong thing for us to do and for the American people. The House plan will expand choice, lower cost, and ensure healthcare access for all.  We're negotiating with everybody.  It’s a big, fat, beautiful negotiation, and hopefully we’ll come up with something that's going to be really terrific.I want to thank Paul Ryan and everybody -- Mitch, everybody, they're all working around the clock.  And I think ultimately the big beneficiary will be the American people.  We’ll end up with a really great healthcare plan.We're also going to send Congress a budget request that will include one of the largest increases to defense spending in our history.  And General/Secretary Mattis is extremely upset about that.  (Laughter.)  And it will be fully paid for, okay?  Fully paid for.  And I saved a lot of money on those jets, didn't I?  Did I do a good job?  More than $725 million on them.  He’s very happy with me.  (Laughter.)  In the first full month of my administration following the issuance of my executive orders, illegal immigration on our southern border fell by an unprecedented 40 percent.  I want to congratulate General Kelly.  At the same time, I’ve issued a presidential memorandum directing the Department of State and the Department of Homeland Security to undertake immediate steps to enhance our vetting process.  So we're further enhancing our vetting process.  We want people in our country who love our country and have the potential to love our country and our people.  That's who we want.  My administration will work every day to serve and protect our great citizens, and we will not rest until the job is done.So this is our first Cabinet meeting.  I hope this is going to be a historic Cabinet meeting -- historic in the sense that we're going to do a fantastic job for the American people, for our country, and for the future of our country.  So thank "
2017-03-13;https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/03/13/remarks-president-trump-listening-session-healthcare;Remarks by President Trump in a Listening Session on Healthcare;"Thank you all for being here today.  It’s a great honor for you to share your personal stories of struggle under the enormous strain imposed on you by the very, very failed and failing Obamacare law.  Secretary Price and I, along with my entire administration, and a lot of people in the Senate and a lot of people in the House are committed to repealing and replacing this disastrous law with a healthcare plan that lowers cost, expands choice, and ensures access for everyone.  You represent the millions of Americans who have seen their Obamacare premiums increase by double digits and even triple digits.  In Arizona, the rates were over 116 percent last year -- 116 percent increase.  And the deductibles are so high you don’t even get to use it.Many Americans lost their plans and doctors altogether, and one-third of the counties -- think of it, one-third only have one insurer left.  The insurance companies are fleeing.  They’re gone; so many gone.  The House bill to repeal and replace Obamacare will provide you and your fellow citizens with more choices -- far more choices at lower cost.  Americans should pick the plan they want.  Now they’ll be able to pick the plan they want, they’ll be able to pick the doctor they want.  They’ll be able to do a lot of things that the other plan was supposed to give and it never gave.  You don’t pick your doctor, you don’t pick your plan -- you remember that one.We’re not going to have one-size-fits-all.  Instead, we’re going to be working to unleash the power of the private marketplace to let insurers come in and compete for your business.  And you’ll see rates go down, down, down, and you’ll see plans go up, up, up.  You’ll have a lot of choices.  You’ll have plans that nobody is even thinking of today.  They will have plans that today nobody has even thought about, because the market is going to enforce that, with millions and millions of people wanting healthcare.  More competition and less regulation will finally bring down the cost of care, and I think it will bring it down very significantly.  Unfortunately, it takes a while to get there, because you have to let that marketplace kick in, and it’s going to take a little while to get there.  Once it does, it’s going to be a thing of beauty.  I wish it didn’t take a year or two years, but that’s what’s going to happen, and that’s the way it works.  But we’re willing to go through that process.Working together, we’ll get the job done.  And I have to say this just in closing, and then I want to hear some of your stories, and we’ll let the press stay for your stories if you like.  But the press is making Obamacare look so good all of a sudden.  I’m watching the news -- looks so good.  They’re showing these reports about ""this one gets so much and this one gets so much.""  First of all, it covers very few people.  And it’s imploding.  And ’17 will be the worst year.  And I said it once, I’ll say it again -- because Obama is gone -- things are going to be very bad this year for the people with Obamacare.  They’re going to have tremendous increases.  And the Republicans, frankly, are putting themselves in a very bad position -- and I tell this to Tom Price all the time -- by repealing Obamacare -- because people aren’t going to see the truly devastating effects of Obamacare.  They’re not going to see the devastation in ’17 and ’18 and ’19.  It'll be gone by then, whether we do it or not.  It’ll be imploded off the map.  So the press is making it look so wonderful so that if we end it, everyone is going to say, ""Oh, remember how great Obamacare used to be, remember how wonderful it used to be, it was so great.""  It’s a little bit like President Obama.  When he left, people liked him.  When he was here, people didn’t like him so much.  That’s the way life goes.  That’s human nature.  The fact is, Obamacare is a disaster.  And I say this to the Republicans all the time:  By repealing it, by getting rid of it, by ending it, everyone is going to say, ""Oh, it used to be so great.""  But it wasn’t great.  And I tell Tom Price and I tell Paul Ryan, I tell everyone of them -- I say, the best thing you can do politically is wait a year, because it’s going to blow itself off the map.  But that’s the wrong thing to do for the country, it’s the wrong thing to do for our citizens.So with that, I’d like to introduce some of the folks and you could say a few words about your experience with Obamacare.  And perhaps the press will even report it.  (Laughter.)  Would you like to start?MS. COUEY:  Yeah, thank you for this opportunity, Mr. President.THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  Thank you.MS. COUEY:  Our rates are three times what they were before Obamacare started.  We have one provider in our county.  We have very little options for what we can and cannot do.  We’re a small-business owner; we’re actually not a brick-and-mortar, we are cattle ranchers.  We can’t afford our equipment if we’re paying these rates year after year after year.Our food source is in jeopardy because of this healthcare law.  It’s my basic --THE PRESIDENT:  I know.  Sorry.  Don't worry.  Don't worry.  This is what’s happening.  It’s gone up three times, and then you have to pay -- if you don’t want to use it, you have to pay.  That’s the all-time beauty.  If you don’t want to use it, you have to pay.  And, Tom, you have to pay big league, right?  Some people say, well, if I use it, I use it, I’m paying too much.  If I don’t use it, I have to pay a penalty.  And do you have to pay penalties?  Do you ever do that, or you have to --MS. COUEY:  We haven’t as of yet, but we were uninsured in December.  They dropped us for the fourth time, after we paid over $50,000 last year for healthcare expenses.THE PRESIDENT:  And it’s gone up triple.  MS. COUEY:  Yes.THE PRESIDENT:  And before Obamacare, you actually had good healthcare.MS. COUEY:  We did.  We had a fantastic plan.THE PRESIDENT:  A lot of people -- nobody ever takes that into account.  I’m not saying the system before was good, because it wasn’t, but millions of people had great healthcare that they loved.  Now, when you start deducting those millions of people from the so-called people that are happy, you have a very small number of people that are happy.  That, I can tell you.  How about you?PARTICIPANT:  Well, we’re kind of the same story as Carrie.  In 2009, I left a full-time job to be a stay-at-home mom to two kids.  For our family, it was never an option to get government assistance; we just don’t believe our neighbors should work harder so that we don’t have to.  So my husband said, if you can pay for our insurance -- which at the time was $650 a month for private health insurance for a family of four -- then that was fine.From 2009 to 2015, that private insurance went up by 102 percent.  Finally, his employer told us in 2015, when it went up the final time an additional 34 percent, that they couldn’t carry our family anymore, so I had to enter back into the workforce but I couldn’t find a job that offered health insurance.  So we entered under Obamacare, and we believed the sales pitch that, ""If you like your doctor you can keep your doctor.""  So even though we were going to have to pay $1,300 a month for Obamacare, we thought we’d still be okay with our doctors.  We were on it for five months.  Our pediatrician for our children wouldn’t take it, my doctor wouldn’t take it, so we paid them $8,000 in five months and were never able to use it.And I think what makes our family story unique is, we’re by no means wealthy.  In 2014, when we entered the exchange, we made $53,000 as a family, my husband and I together -- that was our gross income.  And then in 2015, we made together -- since I had gone back to work -- $74,000.  But when you look at paying $10,000 in health premiums and insurance -- and health costs --THE PRESIDENT:  So it’s been a rough go.PARTICIPANT:  It has, it’s been hard.THE PRESIDENT:  How have you found Obamacare?PARTICIPANT:  We’ll be so happy to see it gone.  I mean, it’s almost put our family in financial ruin, and I think that’s the story for a lot of people.   THE PRESIDENT:  It’s put businesses in financial ruin.PARTICIPANT:  That’s right.  THE PRESIDENT:  It’s one of the biggest costs -- it has been disastrous for businesses.  Go ahead, sir.MR. SEIFE:  Yes, first of all, Mr. President, thank you for having us here.THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.MR. SEIFE:  I think it’s a great opportunity to talk to the American people, people like ourselves that have struggled with the healthcare law.  I myself am from Miami.  I haven’t had very much time to prepare, but the President of the United States calls and I’m here.  (Laughter.)  So it just so happened I had -- every single year for the past couple of years I’ve had a different insurance every single year.  Before, I had an individual plan, my wife and I -- my wife is an attorney, I’m a computer programmer; I’m a small business, my wife is a small business.  And I just don’t understand what happened.  I have a daughter with a disability.  We’ve changed our plan every year.  THE PRESIDENT:  So your insurance was good before Obamacare.MR. SEIFE:  Oh, absolutely.  I never had --THE PRESIDENT:  Many people are like that.  Many, many plans were great before Obamacare.  They were so happy.  And that doesn’t justify the system before Obamacare, but people are miserable now, and it’s putting people out of business and it’s putting them in the poorhouse.  Go ahead.MR. SEIFE:  It’s just that we had to -- they cancelled our plans, and I couldn’t understand why they cancelled our plans.  So we had no other choice.  I remember the President of the United States say that individual plans will not be covered, you need to have an employer-based plan.  I do not work for the government, I do not work for a large employer.THE PRESIDENT:  Very unfair.MR. SEIFE:  We are ground zero.  My case is ground zero for the healthcare law.THE PRESIDENT:  And you represent a lot of people in the same situation.  MR. SEIFE:  Absolutely.THE PRESIDENT:  It’s very unfair.MR. SEIFE:  Like my friend here, she’s in the same situation.  And I think it’s very, very unfair.  And I think that the real scenario was that this law was supposed to implode, like you were saying.  And my parents are from -- came from communist Cuba, they know what socialism is all about.  So I know what socialism is, and that’s pretty much what -- this whole system was meant to have one single provider. THE PRESIDENT:  Well, it turns out it's so expensive it’s almost not socialism when you think about it.  (Laughter.)  You have to pay so much. What do you think?  Go ahead.MS. SERTICH:  I’m from Arizona, and I can tell you that the 116-percent increase is real, it’s not a myth.  I lost my plan three times during the Obamacare era.  After losing it this year I decided to opt out.  So right now I do not have traditional healthcare.And I went from a $365-a-month premium last year to a $809-premium this year.THE PRESIDENT:  And a higher deductible.MS. SERTICH:  The deductible was going to be $6,800, no copays.  So if I went to the doctor, I would be paying out of my pocket, and it just didn’t seem like a good use of my money.  I thought I would be a better steward of that $17,000 at the end of the year should I have reached my deductible, and just decided to opt out.  I went into a faith-based share program, and I’m doing that.  One of the reasons I felt like I can do this -- totally taking a leap of faith -- is because I think -- I know you’re going to get this taken care of.  So I thought it’s only going to be for a year.  I will be on this program, I will opt out of traditional healthcare, or health insurance.  And I think you’re going to get it done.THE PRESIDENT:  You have a lot of people in Arizona paying a big penalty?MS. SERTICH:  Yes.THE PRESIDENT:  You’re paying the penalty?MS. SERTICH:  Well, and my husband also owns his own business and can’t afford to offer insurance to employees.  And his employees who are also in the independent market, it’s just getting too much.  And I’ve had individual insurance for 25 years, since I started my business.  So I’ve always been in that individual market, I’ve always done what was right.  I took responsibility for myself, made sure I was covered for healthcare because I’m a businessperson, I don’t want any huge healthcare expenses to affect the money that could be going to my business now having to go to a health expense.So I was in my mid-20s when I said, you know what, I’ve got to get -- we’ve got to get square with this, I have to have independent insurance.  So, I have.  THE PRESIDENT:  Well, thank you very much.  The people of Arizona have been hit very, very hard.  At least 116 percent.  Here’s the bad news:  It’s going to go up more this year.  Now, if we repeal it, nobody is going to know that, and the press is going to say how wonderful it was, and, gee, we miss Obamacare.  That’s the problem.  It’s the biggest problem I have, Tom.  We’re going to do them a big favor, but it’s not the right way.Go ahead.MR. BROWN:  Mr. President, thank you.THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much, Louis.MR. BROWN:  My name is Louis Brown.  I work for the Christ Medicus Foundation.  I'm an attorney by trade.  In 2009, when the Affordable Care Act was going through Congress -- what became the Affordable Care Act -- I was working for the Democratic National Committee at the time.  I resigned my position because I could tell that the Democratic bill that was going through Congress wanted to publicly fund abortion, and that’s not something that I could go along with.  So I resigned my position, later worked for Congressman Dan Lungren in Congress, and went on to eventually work for the Christ Medicus Foundation.  And we’re focused on building a culture of life, protecting religious liberty in healthcare, protecting the right of conscience, prohibiting the public funding of abortion, and also prohibiting non-discrimination against pro-life medical providers.  Especially as an African American, I'm a graduate of Howard University School of Law.  THE PRESIDENT:  Good school.MR. BROWN:  Yeah.  Thank you, Mr. President.  And I know from Saint John Paul II -- he said that all of our human and civil rights that we believe in as Americans, that we share as Americans -- the right to healthcare, the right to medical care, to housing, to all of these different things -- are illusory if the right to life isn’t defended with maximum determination.  Seventeen million African Americans, it’s shown, that probably have been aborted since Roe v. Wade.  And I supported you in the presidential election, gave several speeches in Michigan telling folks to vote pro-life in the general election, and I’m really happy that you’re here to continue the bipartisan belief that there should be no taxpayer-funding of abortion, and also really to support your effort to show that the patient, the human person, should be at the center of our American healthcare system, not the government.  The government has its place, but the patient should be the center.  So I’m happy to support you, Mr. President. THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  That’s so nice.  Thank you, I appreciate it.  Great job.Yes, go ahead.DR. SETHI:  Mr. President, thank you so much for inviting me.  My name is Dr. Manny, and I run a nonprofit called Healthy Tennessee, and across Tennessee I’m a trauma surgeon.  But what we do is --THE PRESIDENT:  I’ll be in Tennessee on Wednesday.DR. MANNY:  We look forward to hosting you, sir.THE PRESIDENT:  I’ll see you there.DR. MANNY:  Yes, sir.  We do these large community events in rural Appalachia, across Tennessee, where we host these health fairs taking care of patients.  So it’s really a grassroots effort -- something that you understand better than anybody -- where people come out just to help people.  Doctors, nurses on the ground, helping folks with preventative medicine, educating folks.  That’s what we do.But the one thing I’ve been seeing across Tennessee is that folks really can’t afford these rising premiums.  So what they’re doing is, effectively, they’re paying the tax penalty because it’s cheaper and it works out better than paying for the insurance.  And so that’s been a big problem that we’re seeing across the state.  So thank you so much for what you’re doing to tackle this problem.THE PRESIDENT:  So you’ve seen a big problem, and the way out of the problem is to do a plan much more like the plan we’re going to get done.DR. MANNY:  Yes, sir.THE PRESIDENT:  We’ll get that out -- without penalties too, by the way.  People don’t mention all of the facts.  You know, the other thing about what we’re talking about -- we really have a three-phase plan.  They only want to talk about the first phase.  The first phase is just the most basic of phases, and then you have phase two, which is largely done by our Secretary, and then you have phase three, which is a lot of the bells and whistles.  But they don’t want to talk about the bells and whistles.  So they’re really comparing things to something that won’t be there for long.  And the reason we have to do it that way is because of Congress.  I’d love to do it all in one package, but if you did it that way, it can’t get done.  So we’re going to get something done that’s going to be terrific.I appreciate it.  Thank you, doctor, very much.  Yes, sir.  Go ahead.MR. BROWN:  Thank you, Mr. President.  I’d like to thank you for the opportunity to be here today.  I, too, am from Tennessee, and I, too, am in the farming industry.THE PRESIDENT:  Good.MR. BROWN:  And the effect that I’ve had through Obamacare is my wife's and my daughter's insurance is supplied through her work, I buy my own.  And I’ve seen the increases, since Obamacare, to the tune of about $5,000 a year, just for me.  And I have considered taking the option of the penalty because -- my problem with the penalty is, though, if I opt out of the program, and buy a private plan -- just a catastrophic plan because I’m a very healthy man -- if I take that option, not only is my income penalized, but my wife’s income as well, because she makes a considerable more amount of money than I do, but she has insurance.  So I don’t think that’s fair.  And I don’t think -- the rate increase is just astronomical, and I’m in the county that only has one option -- BlueCross BlueShield of Tennessee --and I’ve got about $540-a-month premium for the $7,000 out-of-pocket deductible before I see any help at all.  And I even got to pay a high premium for a plan that I don’t need or don’t want --THE PRESIDENT:  Will you be able to continue, in the years to come, if you have to keep going like this?MR. BROWN:  They’re dropping out every day -- the suppliers in other counties.  There’s 35 counties in Tennessee that has no options at all right now.  I don’t know what those folks do.THE PRESIDENT:  You know what that means?  That means somebody is going to make a lot of money.  You know that.  They’re going to make a lot of money.  (Laughter.)   Somebody is going to -- well, a few.  You’re not going to make it.  They’re going to make it.  There are people very happy about this situation.MR. BROWN:  Thank you for the opportunity to be here.  THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I appreciate.  Thank you, Joel.Doctor?DR. ARMSTRONG:  Yes, sir.  Well, I’m a physician in Texas, and thank you for allowing me to be here today.  And I’ll tell you, what I’ve seen is that a lot of patients really are not adequately covered by Obamacare.  It was supposed to cover people who had -- like everyone has said here -- with the rising premiums and the rising deductibles.  I take care of patients in the hospital, and the patients are shocked to get a $20,000 bill, and to find that they’re responsible for $6,000 of that because their deductible is so high.  And that’s just the situation that cannot continue.Medicaid expansion under Obamacare really doesn’t cover folks either, because many physicians are not even taking Medicare.  They’re not accepting it any longer in the outpatient setting.  And so folks who have chronic medical illnesses, like cancer -- I mean, my wife is a breast cancer survivor, and most of her treatment was actually as an outpatient.  It was very expensive outpatient care.  Most physicians don’t even accept Medicaid, so those patients are still uncovered.And so the Medicaid expansion really hasn’t covered them.  The folks who have Obamacare insurance really are inadequately covered as well because they’re still paying extremely high premiums and then having to pay extremely high deductibles.  And so it’s really --THE PRESIDENT:  And do they even reach it with the high deductibles?  They don’t even reach it for the most part.DR. ARMSTRONG:  You know, oftentimes they do not, unless they have some sort of serious medical problem, and they’re in the hospital, and it’s very expensive -- they don’t even reach their deductible oftentimes.  And so it’s unfortunate.  So I really appreciate it.  I actually read the bill that’s been produced that’s coming out of the House now, and I really like a lot of the changes in it.  I think that this is going to correct a lot of the issues that Obamacare has had.  So I really appreciate what you all are doing.THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I appreciate it, doctor.  Thank you.  Say hello to your wife.  DR. ARMSTRONG:  Yes, sir.  I will.  Thank you.THE PRESIDENT:  Very nice.  Thank you.Gina.MS. SELL:  Hi, Mr. President, I’m Gina.  I’m from Wisconsin.  I’m a nurse, I’m a mom, and I am part of that huge group of middle-class families that were impacted by the ACA.  Before ACA, we had insurance that was eventually cancelled, and I had written a letter to our senator just asking him, what do I do?  Do I quit my job completely so that we can obtain a subsidy -- a job that I love, as a nurse in a hospital that I love?  Or do I uproot my family and try to find a job with benefits that doesn’t even cover the medical -- THE PRESIDENT:  So the healthcare is -- the Obamacare forced you to actually -- in a sense, forces you, economically and almost potentially, to get another job.  MS. SELL:  Right.THE PRESIDENT:  Even though you like your job.MS. SELL:  Right.  So I did end up getting a full-time position at the hospital that I worked at.  But that came with a price because I was working three days a week, and spending time with my small children, who are my number-one priority.  And after the ACA, I was forced -- because we could not afford a premium of $1,200 per month and a deductible that didn’t cover anything -- to find a job with benefits.THE PRESIDENT:  Meaning the deductible was so high that, essentially, unless you had a really big problem, you wouldn’t even be able to use it.The deductible was so high that essentially unless you had a really big problem, you wouldn’t even be able to use it.MS. SELL:  Correct, yes.  And we're still in that boat.  I mean, right now our deductible is $6,500.  And so if I have a child who's extremely sick, it's going to cost me hundreds of dollars.  Just last week, my daughter had a fever, and I sent her to school for three days straight because I had to work to afford our assurance, and I couldn’t afford to bring her to the doctor.  So it has been devastating for our family.THE PRESIDENT:  It's really not having insurance at all.  A lot of Obamacare, you don’t really have insurance because the deductibles are so high that you really don’t have insurance, if you think about it.All right.  Thank you very much.  Good luck.MS. SELL:  Thank you.THE PRESIDENT:  Yes, sir.MR. KNOX:  Mr. President, thank you very much for hosting us.  This is great.  I have to start with something.  As I was leaving the house, my 11-year-old ran up to me and said, ""Dad, I'd like to have you give this to Mr. President for me.""  (Laughter.)  THE PRESIDENT:  What do you have there?  I wished I looked that good.  (Laughter.) MR. KNOX:  ""Dear President Trump, it is a great honor to be able to write to the President of the USA.  I think you are a great President and a great man.  Also, don't worry, the picture of you on the front of this looks nothing like you.""  (Laughter.) THE PRESIDENT:  (Laughter.)  That's very nice.  Thank you.  Thank you.  I wish I looked that good. MR. KNOX:  So I had the privilege of meeting with Secretary Price and Vice President Pence in Cincinnati about a week and a half ago at a roundtable, and I'll share with you what I shared with them.  I started with a quote from the great President, Ronald Reagan, who said, ""The most terrifying words in the English language are we're from the government and we're here to help.'""  (Laughter.)  Kind of my feeling on healthcare.  Frankly, I think that the system was broken before the last administration got their hands on it.  I started my company 21 years ago, and I had a vision of wanting to provide 100 percent full family healthcare for as long as I had a company, because I really felt in my heart that it was the right thing to do.  I was one of the last holdouts.  But, sadly, after about 15 years, I really had a choice of either having a company or being able to provide my employees that level of healthcare.  And that's sad.  I tell my wife all the time -- you can have anything you want, we just can't everything we want.  We have the best healthcare system in the world -- we do -- but it needs to be fixed -- whether it's small business owners, like myself -- I'm a manufacturer, I'm on several boards in the Midwest in manufacturing.  What we'd like to see is not a government-operated market, but a free market.  I sell (inaudible) equipment for a living.  We have a trade show every year, and there's hundreds and hundreds of people selling competitive products.  If we had a healthcare show in my town, there would be three or four people under that roof.  And as a businessman yourself, you know what that does to driving down costs or the lack thereof.  So we would like to see more of a free-market solution, going back to what made this country great -- entrepreneurialism instead of empowerments; work ethics instead of welfare.  And that's what we'd like to ask you for.  And I'd like to say thank you very much.THE PRESIDENT:  As you know, that's what we're doing largely, but we also have to take care of people that can't afford to be in a position like you are.  So we're going to do that.  Largely, I think beyond everything, if you look at what's going to happen -- the competitive bidding -- every element of what we're doing is competitive bidding, but we have to take care of people who need the help.  And there are a lot of people like that.MR. KNOX:  There's always been a safety net in the United States, and there should be.  And, unfortunately, when I see 50,000 -- or 50 million Americans taking assistance in -- you know, they're market food stamps.  That's like -- for the people who really can't provide for themselves, you know, we're all charitable people who are Americans, we're the most generous nation on the face of the Earth.  So I totally believe in safety nets for those who need them, not free handouts for (inaudible). THE PRESIDENT:  We’re going to help a lot of people, but we are going to be very much free market people.  They can afford -- and they'll be off the cost.Go ahead, Stan.MR. SUMMERS:  I'm Mr. Stan Summers from Box Elder County, northern Utah.  I think I'm probably the only other elected official here besides you guys.  It's been an interesting ride to watch the healthcare system in the last 26 years.  When my son was born, he was three and a half months premature, 26 years ago.  And we had really good insurance.  We basically didn’t have to pay anything out of pocket besides what we were doing from where I worked.  As time went on, you could kind of tell the healthcare system has been a little bit broke, and then all of a sudden the ACA -- and I'm not going to call it the other word -- I call it the last President's healthcare program.  I don’t want to say that name.  So anyway --THE PRESIDENT:  Other than that, you like him a lot, right?  (Laughter.)  MR. SUMMERS:  Yeah, exactly.  (Laughter.)  It's gotten to the point where I own a couple of businesses too and do the things that I have to do.  I actually ran for government so I could have insurance -- and won.  But now I'm looking at these people, saying, how can I provide insurance for them without raising taxes and doing these things that are happening -- because everything has gone up.  Utah didn’t expand Medicaid -- we weren’t a part of that -- and we can see why now, because of the things that are happening throughout the nation with states and companies and everybody else going bankrupt.So it got to the point where I ended up -- not only with my businesses -- I have to drive a school bus to keep my wife at home with my kid that was ill.  So now I own three businesses, I drive a school bus, and I'm an elected official, to be able to continue to do the things that I need to do with healthcare.  The last three -- well, the last three years -- THE PRESIDENT:  So it's gone through the roof.MR. SUMMERS:  Oh, I got a $6,000 deductible -- HSA -- but I will meet that again in three months.  So I'm at -- I think my wife said morning, at 4,800 or 4,900 bucks already this year in March to be able to meet my out-of-pocket.  And so by the time April comes, I would have met that to be able to continue to do.  And if there was one thing I probably could ask you about -- and my boy has got a rare disease, and I appreciate you talking about the rare [disease] community in your speeches -- is that if somebody has cancer or somebody has a rare disease or continues to have problems, why do we have to do a deductible every year?  So I’m sitting there at Christmas going, okay, my deductible has been met for six or eight months, and I’m going to turn around and have to do it again for the same disease, for the same symptoms, for the same everything. THE PRESIDENT:  That's interesting.  Tom, could you answer that?  That would be interesting.SECRETARY PRICE:  It’s all about the risk and spreading the risk with insurance over a period of time.  But it is a challenge for individuals with chronic disease, there’s no doubt about it.MR. SUMMERS:  And I appreciate you even thinking about it and talking about grassroots, and when you're talking about all the people that we support with the farmers and ranchers, and the small-business people, and the people that are in manufacturing, our county is one of the largest manufacturing counties in the nation per capita.  And Nucor would love to tell you thanks -- Nucor Steel would love to tell you thanks for everything you've been doing.THE PRESIDENT:  Nucor has been very good.  It’s going to get better, too.MR. SUMMERS:  And we've got a ton of those.  The space program -- we used to make the shuttle boosters out of ATK Thiokal.  And we’d love to have the space program.  I got a really good friend.THE PRESIDENT:  Those days are gone, but they're coming back.MR. SUMMERS:  I’ve got a friend that's going to go up in the next little bit, Lieutenant Commander Scott Maker Tingle, who is headed up on a spaceship from Russia.  But he would love to come back to the United States and be able to go up through the United States.  So all those jobs I know will come back with you.THE PRESIDENT:  Well, Gary Cohn, who is sitting right next to you, he’s a big believer in what you're saying -- right, Gary?MR. SUMMERS:  If there’s anything we can do to help you, the counties are behind you.  We can find you low-hanging fruit to be able to pick off that tree to help with jobs.  Just let us know where we can help.THE PRESIDENT:  Good.  Thank you, Stan.MR. SUMMERS:  Thank you for your time.THE PRESIDENT:  Would you have anything to say, Tom, generally speaking? SECRETARY PRICE:  Well, let me start, Mr. President -- really powerful about the consequences of the current law, and you hear people’s lives that have been affected in remarkably adverse ways that sometimes you don't think about as it relates to healthcare -- whether it’s businesses that haven’t been able to survive, or individuals who need to take three, four, five jobs; moms that can't be with their kids when they want.  This is about real people.  It’s about real patients.  And so working with you and your leadership, we are really excited about the opportunity to put in place a patient-centered system where patients and families and doctors are making decisions, and not Washington, D.C. THE PRESIDENT:  What about the concept that -- and everybody knows it’s happening -- that Obamacare is imploding, that if we don't do anything, it’s not even going to be around in another year?  The insurance companies are fleeing.  But now it seems to be getting this wonderful press like it’s a wonderful thing, and it’s a horrible thing actually, and getting worse.  And ’17 will be, by far, the worst year so far.  SECRETARY PRICE:  Yes.THE PRESIDENT:  Because a lot of things were put into ’17.  But ’17 is going to be worse, and I assume ’18 will be worse even than ’17.  So it’s essentially gone.  How do you respond to that?  Because I’ve been telling you, ""Why don't we wait?  Just let it implode, and let’s not take the blame.""  I’ve been telling you that as an option.  It’s not an option I like, frankly, but it’s certainly an option.  How do you respond to that?SECRETARY PRICE:  I think ’18 can be better if we implement the law and we utilize the regulatory process to make some --THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I’m not saying that.  I’m saying, if we don't implement the law, what happens with Obamacare?  What’s going on with Obamacare?SECRETARY PRICE:  What you’ll see is a magnification of all these stories around this table:  more businesses being harmed, more individuals not having the kind of income that they -- disposable income that they would use, more moms and dads not able to care for their kids in the way that they believe to be most appropriate, more people getting insurance but no care.  This is about real people’s lives, and that's why it’s so important.THE PRESIDENT:  Getting insurance but not being able to use it because the deductibles are so high.SECRETARY PRICE:  That's exactly right.THE PRESIDENT:  And you hear these stories where they're paying a fortune for insurance, and then you hear how high their deductible is.  And unless they have a tragedy in their family, they're never going to be able to use it.SECRETARY PRICE:  Yes, this fellow has to -- $13,000 before the insurance kicks in.  That's what he has to pay -- $13,000.MR. SEIFE:  That's like not having insurance.SECRETARY PRICE:  That's like not having insurance.THE PRESIDENT:  Well, keep working it.MS. SERTICH:  They're catastrophic plans now.  SECRETARY PRICE:  Exactly. THE PRESIDENT:  He’s been working very hard, and he’s doing a great job.  Mr. Vice President, do you have anything to say?THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Mr. President, I think what unequivocally these great Americans see in high relief is you're someone who puts people over politics.  And I just want to thank all of them for coming, and in front of the national media, talking about the real world and impacts of Obamacare.  You've said it consistently over the last two years that Obamacare has failed.  But these people are emblematic of the Americans that Obamacare has failed.  And I just am so grateful for their time, but so grateful for your compassionate leadership in driving the Congress and driving our nation toward better healthcare outcomes for them and better solutions built on those American principles of more consumer choices, more free market, but also, as you said, the caring for the most vulnerable by allowing our states to innovate and medicate in ways that will create even better healthcare coverage than they have today.THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Mike.  Thank you, everybody.  Thank you very much. Q    Mr. President, do you have any message for those who are concerned about losing their insurance, whether it be Medicaid or higher costs (inaudible)?THE PRESIDENT:  It will get better.  If we're allowed to do what we want to do, it will get better -- much better.  Hopefully it will get very good. Q    So will it take long?THE PRESID"
2017-03-10;https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/03/10/remarks-president-trump-healthcare-discussion-key-house-committee;Remarks by President Trump in a Healthcare Discussion with Key House Committee Chairmen;Hello, everybody.  I want to thank each of the House committee leaders for being with us today.  Your devotion and leadership has been amazing, and I want to just applaud you and the diligent work of your committees to advance the Obamacare repeal-and-replacement legislation that we’ve been talking about for a long time, and that we’ve been running with and I ran with, and I can tell you.  And that’s what people want, they want repeal-and-replace.  The bill passed just now through Ways and Means, and it will -- I think the committee just voted recently, right?  REPRESENTATIVE WALDEN:  Yep.THE PRESIDENT:  Your other committee --REPRESENTATIVE WALDEN:  Energy.THE PRESIDENT:  Energy and Commerce.  And it was a very good vote, and congratulations.  That was a good job.  Amazing.We must act now to save Americans from the imploding Obamacare disaster.  Premiums have skyrocketed by double-digits and triple-digits in some cases.  As an example, Arizona -- which I talk about all the time -- 116 percent increase and it’s going up a lot higher.  ’17 would be a disaster for Obamacare.  That’s the year it was meant to explode, because Obama won’t be here.  That was when it was supposed to be -- it will get even worse.  As bad as it is now, it’ll get even worse.Choices are disappearing as one insurer drops out after another.  Today, one-third of all counties now have only one insurer on the Obamacare exchanges, and the exchanges themselves are a disaster.  The House repeal-and-replace plan ends the Obamacare tax hikes, cutting taxes by hundreds of billions of dollars.  It eliminates the Obamacare mandate that forces Americans to buy government-approved plans.  We all know that one.  It provides states with flexibility over how Medicaid dollars are spent, giving power from Washington and back to local government, which we all want to see.  We’re going to do a much better job.  And the plan empowers individual Americans to buy the health insurance that is right for them, not the plan forced on them by government.  You all remember, you can keep your doctor, you can keep your plan.  I know, Greg, you’ve never heard that, right?  But it was said many, many times, and it turned out to be not true.This is the time we’re going to get it done.  We’re working together, we have some great results, we have tremendous spirit, and I think it’s something that is just going to happen very shortly.  So thank

Great job.  Really a fantastic job.  We just did a tour.  I was given a couple of beautiful cards by the students -- really well done.  And I appreciate it.And Bishop Noonan, thank you so much.  A very powerful man, and I -- the most powerful man, right?  (Laughter.)  And I appreciate it very much for your uplifting prayer.  I have to say that your support of schools like St. Andrews Catholic School has been incredible.  Everybody talks about it.  They talk about you.  You understand how much the students benefit from full education, one that enriches both the mind and the soul, a combination -- and that's a good combination.Latrina, I want to just thank you.  The job you've done is incredible.  Everyone -- we've been talking about you actually you have a big reputation in Florida.  You do know that, right?  (Laughter.)  For your talent and a lot of other things.  But I see it -- and for your love of what you do.  Because I could see as soon as I met you, the love that you have for what you do is really fantastic.  So I want to thank you very much.And Superintendent Fortier -- where is Superintendent?  Where is Superintendent?  You have been -- come here.  You have been fantastic.  And the job you're doing and willing to do is going to be -- I think with what's happening and with people like Marco and Rick Scott and the President and seeing this today -- I mean, it just -- it's going to get further and further because I know they're big fans.So I'm grateful to have everybody here today.  I'm also very pleased and -- where is Rick Scott?  Right over here, Governor Scott and Senator Marco Rubio and, as you know, Secretary DeVos -- she was approved a couple of weeks ago.  And she's the one that we all report to when it comes to education.  And I know you're going to have a fantastic relationship with the Secretary, and that's going to be a lot of good things for your school and for the entire system.St. Andrews Catholic School represents one of the many parochial schools dedicated to the education of some of our nation's most disadvantaged children.  But they're becoming just the opposite very rapidly through education and with the help of the school choice programs.  This month, we commemorate the thousands of peaceful activists for justice who joined Martin Luther King on the march from Selma to Montgomery.  And that day, Reverend King hoped that inferior education would become, as he said, ""a thing of the past.""  And we're going to work very much for the future and what he predicted would be with the future.  As I've often said in my address to Congress and just about anyplace else I can speak, education is the civil rights issue of our time.  And it's why I've asked Congress to support a school-choice bill.  And we've come a long way.  I think we really -- we're right out there and we're ahead of -- we're ahead of schedule in so many ways when it comes to education.  And, again, Betsy is going to lead that -- you're going to lead that charge, right?  SECRETARY DEVOS:  You bet.THE PRESIDENT:  You're going to do a fantastic job.  Denisha Merriweather is with us today and you were so wonderful the other night.MS. MERRIWEATHER:  Thank you.THE PRESIDENT:  That was quite a night.  I will say that, Denisha.  I was honored that Denisha joined Melania and myself as our guest to my address to Congress.  Denisha is the first in her family to graduate high school and college, and is about to complete her master's degree in social work, right?  (Applause.)  And Denisha, we want millions more to have the same chance to achieve the great success that you're achieving right now.  And you think that can be done, I'll bet, right?MS. MERRIWEATHER:  Of course.THE PRESIDENT:  Look at that.  (Laughter.)  Her eyes light up.  And that's good news.  So I want to thank all of the parents and teachers and students at St. Andrews and all of the graduates that are with us today.  It's a special place.  It's also a special state.  Florida, to me, is a very, very special, special state.  I mean, I know those people back there -- they know why I like it so much.  We've had a lot of success in Florida and I love it.  It's my second home.  I'm here all the time.  We have the Southern White House in Florida.  (Laughter.)  And we get a lot of work done -- believe me, there's not rest at the Southern White House -- it's all work.  And we love this state.  And we love this state, the way it's managed between Marco and Rick and some of the others.  They're doing a great job and we appreciate it very much.  An"

Thank you very much.  What an honor.  They just gave me this beautiful jacket.  They said, here, Mr. President, please take this home.  I said, let me wear it.  (Laughter.)  And then they gave me the beautiful hat, and I said, you know, maybe I'll do that.  We have a great ""Make America Great Again"" hat, but I said, this is a special day, we're wearing this.  Right?  (Applause.)  I have no idea how it looks, but I think it looks good.  It's a great-looking hat -- just like this is a great-looking ship.Thank you.  I'm privileged to stand here today with the incredible men and women of the United States Navy.  (Applause.)  American sailors are the best warfighting sailors anywhere in the world.  And it's not even close.  And, Susan, I am so glad you could be with us.  I know how hard you work -- 17 visits.  And she wanted things done right, I will tell you.  They told me she wanted this one done right, in honor of both of her parents, who were great, great people.  And we wanted to introduce this beautiful vessel to the American people.  And I wanted to be here, I wanted to be with you.  So, Susan, and to your family -- unbelievable job.  Unbelievable.  (Applause.)  The soon-to-be commissioned Gerald R. Ford USS -- what a place.  It really feels like a place.  You stand on that deck, and you feel like you're standing on a very big piece of land.  But this is better than land.  It will not only be a great symbol of American strength, but a great legacy for your father, and our former President, Gerald Ford.President Ford was a Navy man.  By the way, he was also a great athlete, for those of you that didn’t know.  He saw action in the South Pacific during World War II.  He served this country with honor -- in the military, in Congress, and in the White House.  The proud dignity of this ship is a fitting tribute to Gerald Ford, the man and the President.  Congratulations to all of the men and women who helped build it.  This is American craftsmanship at its biggest, at its best, at its finest.  American workers are the greatest anywhere in the world.  This warship, and all who serve on it, should be a source of shared pride for our nation.  We are joined today -- (applause) -- better believe it, right?  Better believe it.  (Applause.)  Better believe it.  And, by the way, we're going to soon have more coming.  We'll have more coming.  (Applause.)    We are joined today by General Mattis, now Secretary Mattis -- (applause) -- where is he? -- who will be charged with overseeing this great rebuilding of our military might.  We will give the men and women of America’s armed services the resources you need to keep us safe.  We will have the finest equipment in the world -- planes, ships and everything else.  We are going to have, very soon, the finest equipment in the world.  (Applause.)We will give our military the tools you need to prevent war and, if required, to fight war and only do one thing -- you know what that is?  Win!  Win!  (Applause.)  We're going to start winning again.Admiral John Richardson, Chief of Naval Operations, is with us today as well -- great gentleman.  Admiral, we're going to ensure our Navy has the resources, personnel training and equipment -- the kind of equipment that you need.  So, congratulations, Admiral.  And a lot more is coming.  (Applause.)Let me congratulate Captain Richard McCormack, Commanding Officer of the Gerald R. Ford.  This ship will make an extraordinary addition to the fleet like no other -- like no other.  Anywhere in the world there's nothing like this.  It represents the future of naval aviation.  I have no greater privilege than to serve as your Commander-in-Chief and the Commander-in-Chief of the men and women of the United States military.  Great people.  (Applause.)  Great, great people.  I salute you, and I salute our sailors.  I will always support you and your mission.  I will never, ever let you down.  And I also have to recognize Mike Petters, President and CEO of Huntington Ingalls Industries along with Matt Mulherin, President of Newport News Shipbuilding.  (Applause.)  They won't let you down either.  (Applause.)  They're not going to let you down either.  (Applause.)To those who serve our nation in uniform and to those who build the instruments of our defense, I thank you on behalf of our nation.  AUDIENCE MEMBER:  U-S-A!THE PRESIDENT:  (Laughter.)  I agree, I agree.  (Laughter.)  Our carriers are the centerpiece of American military might overseas.  We are standing today on 4.5 acres of combat power and sovereign U.S. territory, the likes of which there is nothing to compete.  There is no competition to this ship.  It is a monument to American might that will provide the strength necessary to ensure peace.  This ship will carry 4,500 personnel and 70 aircraft, and will be a vital component of our defense.  This carrier and the new ships in the Ford class will expand the ability of our nation to carry out vital missions on the oceans to project American power in distant lands.  Hopefully, it's power we don’t have to use, but if we do, they're in big, big trouble.  (Applause.)This great aircraft carrier provides essential capabilities to keep us safe from terrorism and take the fight to the enemy for many years in the future.  The great Admiral Nimitz, who commanded the U.S. Pacific fleet through the Second World War, once said, ""It is the function of the Navy to carry the war to the enemy so that we'll not be fought on U.S. soil.""  True.  (Applause.)  And it was under Admiral Nimitz's command 75 years ago this June that the Navy did just that at the Battle of Midway.  You've all known about the Battle of Midway, where the sailors of the U.S. Navy fought with the bravery that will be remembered throughout the ages.  Storied bravery throughout the ages.  The backbone of the American fleet at Midway was three beautiful aircraft carriers:  the Yorktown, the Enterprise and the Hornet.  All three were built with American hands right here at the Newport News Shipyard.  (Applause.)  At Midway, America was greatly outnumbered by, I mean, a lot -- (laughter) -- and its fleet badly damaged.  But the heroic deeds changed the course of history.  Many brave Americans died that day, and, through their sacrifice, they turned the tide of the Pacific War.  It was a tough tide, it was a big tide, it was a vicious tide, and they turned it.Countless other Americans in that war, some of them parents and grandparents to people in this room today, came home thanks to their very heroic deeds.  The sailors at Midway are part of a long line of American heroes, an unbroken chain of patriots from each generation to the next, who rose to defend our flag and our freedom.  That legacy continues today as American warriors protect our people from the threat of terrorism.  On Tuesday, in my address to a joint session of Congress, I asked Congress to eliminate the defense sequester and to support my request for a great rebuilding of the United States military and the United States Navy.  (Applause.)  After years of endless budget cuts that have impaired our defenses, I am calling for one of the largest defense-spending increases in history.  And by eliminating the sequester and the uncertainty it creates, we will make it easier for the Navy to plan for the future and thus to control costs and get the best deals for the taxpayer, which, of course, is very important, right?  Got to get a good deal.  If we don’t make a good deal, we’re not doing our job. The same boat for less money.  The same ship for less money.  The same airplanes for less money.  That’s what we’re doing.  That’s what we’re doing.  Means we’re going to get more of them, and we can use them.  Our military requires sustained, stable funding to meet the growing needs placed on our defense.  Right now, our aging frontline strike and strike-fighters -- the whole aircraft; many, many aircraft -- are often more likely to be downed for maintenance than they are to be up in the sky.  Our Navy is now the smallest it’s been since, believe it or not, World War I.  Don’t worry, it's going to soon be the largest it’s been.  Don’t worry.  (Applause.)  Think of that.  Think of that.In these troubled times, our Navy is the smallest it’s been since World War I.  That’s a long time ago.  In fact, I just spoke with Navy and industry leaders and have discussed my plans to undertake a major expansion of our entire Navy fleet, including having the 12-carrier Navy we need.  (Applause.)  We also need more aircraft, modernized capabilities, and greater force levels.  Additionally, we must vastly improve our cyber capabilities.  This great rebuilding effort will create many jobs in Virginia, and all across America, and it will also spur new technology and new innovation.America has always been the country that boldly leads the world into the future, and my budget will ensure we do so and continue to do exactly that.  American ships will sail the seas.  American planes will soar the skies.  American workers will build our fleets.  (Applause.)  And America’s military will ensure that even though the darkest nights and throughout, a bright and glowing sun will always shine on our nation and on our people. Our Navy is great.  Our Navy is great.  Our people are great.  Great.  (Applause.)  Our Republic will meet any challenge, defeat any danger, face any threat, and always seek true and lasting peace.  May God bless our military.  May God bless our Navy.  May God bless the wonderful Gerald Ford family.  And may God continue to bless the United S"
2017-02-28;https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/02/28/remarks-president-trump-joint-address-congress;Remarks by President Trump in Joint Address to Congress;"Thank you very much.  Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, members of Congress, the First Lady of the United States -- (applause) -- and citizens of America:Tonight, as we mark the conclusion of our celebration of Black History Month, we are reminded of our nation's path towards civil rights and the work that still remains to be done.  (Applause.)  Recent threats targeting Jewish community centers and vandalism of Jewish cemeteries, as well as last week's shooting in Kansas City, remind us that while we may be a nation divided on policies, we are a country that stands united in condemning hate and evil in all of its very ugly forms.  (Applause.)Each American generation passes the torch of truth, liberty and justice in an unbroken chain all the way down to the present.  That torch is now in our hands.  And we will use it to light up the world.  I am here tonight to deliver a message of unity and strength, and it is a message deeply delivered from my heart.  A new chapter -- (applause) -- of American Greatness is now beginning.  A new national pride is sweeping across our nation.  And a new surge of optimism is placing impossible dreams firmly within our grasp.What we are witnessing today is the renewal of the American spirit.  Our allies will find that America is once again ready to lead.  (Applause.)  All the nations of the world -- friend or foe -- will find that America is strong, America is proud, and America is free.In nine years, the United States will celebrate the 250th anniversary of our founding -- 250 years since the day we declared our independence.  It will be one of the great milestones in the history of the world.  But what will America look like as we reach our 250th year?  What kind of country will we leave for our children?I will not allow the mistakes of recent decades past to define the course of our future.  For too long, we've watched our middle class shrink as we've exported our jobs and wealth to foreign countries.  We've financed and built one global project after another, but ignored the fates of our children in the inner cities of Chicago, Baltimore, Detroit, and so many other places throughout our land.We've defended the borders of other nations while leaving our own borders wide open for anyone to cross and for drugs to pour in at a now unprecedented rate.  And we've spent trillions and trillions of dollars overseas, while our infrastructure at home has so badly crumbled.Then, in 2016, the Earth shifted beneath our feet.  The rebellion started as a quiet protest, spoken by families of all colors and creeds -- families who just wanted a fair shot for their children and a fair hearing for their concerns.But then the quiet voices became a loud chorus as thousands of citizens now spoke out together, from cities small and large, all across our country.  Finally, the chorus became an earthquake, and the people turned out by the tens of millions, and they were all united by one very simple, but crucial demand: that America must put its own citizens first.  Because only then can we truly make America great again.  (Applause.)Dying industries will come roaring back to life.  Heroic veterans will get the care they so desperately need.  Our military will be given the resources its brave warriors so richly deserve.  Crumbling infrastructure will be replaced with new roads, bridges, tunnels, airports and railways gleaming across our very, very beautiful land.  Our terrible drug epidemic will slow down and, ultimately, stop.  And our neglected inner cities will see a rebirth of hope, safety and opportunity.  Above all else, we will keep our promises to the American people.  (Applause.)  It's been a little over a month since my inauguration, and I want to take this moment to update the nation on the progress I've made in keeping those promises.Since my election, Ford, Fiat-Chrysler, General Motors, Sprint, Softbank, Lockheed, Intel, Walmart and many others have announced that they will invest billions and billions of dollars in the United States, and will create tens of thousands of new American jobs.  (Applause.)The stock market has gained almost $3 trillion in value since the election on November 8th, a record.  We've saved taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars by bringing down the price of a fantastic -- and it is a fantastic -- new F-35 jet fighter, and we'll be saving billions more on contracts all across our government.  We have placed a hiring freeze on non-military and non-essential federal workers.We have begun to drain the swamp of government corruption by imposing a five-year ban on lobbying by executive branch officials and a lifetime ban -- (applause) -- thank you -- and a lifetime ban on becoming lobbyists for a foreign government.We have undertaken a historic effort to massively reduce job-crushing regulations, creating a deregulation task force inside of every government agency.  (Applause.)  And we’re imposing a new rule which mandates that for every one new regulation, two old regulations must be eliminated.  (Applause.)  We’re going to stop the regulations that threaten the future and livelihood of our great coal miners.  (Applause.)We have cleared the way for the construction of the Keystone and Dakota Access Pipelines -- (applause) -- thereby creating tens of thousands of jobs.  And I've issued a new directive that new American pipelines be made with American steel.  (Applause.)We have withdrawn the United States from the job-killing Trans-Pacific Partnership.  (Applause.)  And with the help of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, we have formed a council with our neighbors in Canada to help ensure that women entrepreneurs have access to the networks, markets and capital they need to start a business and live out their financial dreams.  (Applause.)To protect our citizens, I have directed the Department of Justice to form a Task Force on Reducing Violent Crime.  I have further ordered the Departments of Homeland Security and Justice, along with the Department of State and the Director of National Intelligence, to coordinate an aggressive strategy to dismantle the criminal cartels that have spread all across our nation.  (Applause.)  We will stop the drugs from pouring into our country and poisoning our youth, and we will expand treatment for those who have become so badly addicted.  (Applause.)At the same time, my administration has answered the pleas of the American people for immigration enforcement and border security.  (Applause.)  By finally enforcing our immigration laws, we will raise wages, help the unemployed, save billions and billions of dollars, and make our communities safer for everyone.  (Applause.)  We want all Americans to succeed, but that can't happen in an environment of lawless chaos.  We must restore integrity and the rule of law at our borders.  (Applause.)For that reason, we will soon begin the construction of a great, great wall along our southern border.  (Applause.)  As we speak tonight, we are removing gang members, drug dealers, and criminals that threaten our communities and prey on our very innocent citizens.  Bad ones are going out as I speak, and as I promised throughout the campaign.To any in Congress who do not believe we should enforce our laws, I would ask you this one question:  What would you say to the American family that loses their jobs, their income, or their loved one because America refused to uphold its laws and defend its borders?  (Applause.)Our obligation is to serve, protect, and defend the citizens of the United States.  We are also taking strong measures to protect our nation from radical Islamic terrorism.  (Applause.)  According to data provided by the Department of Justice, the vast majority of individuals convicted of terrorism and terrorism-related offenses since 9/11 came here from outside of our country.  We have seen the attacks at home -- from Boston to San Bernardino to the Pentagon, and, yes, even the World Trade Center.We have seen the attacks in France, in Belgium, in Germany, and all over the world.  It is not compassionate, but reckless to allow uncontrolled entry from places where proper vetting cannot occur.  (Applause.)  Those given the high honor of admission to the United States should support this country and love its people and its values.  We cannot allow a beachhead of terrorism to form inside America.  We cannot allow our nation to become a sanctuary for extremists.  (Applause.)That is why my administration has been working on improved vetting procedures, and we will shortly take new steps to keep our nation safe and to keep out those out who will do us harm.  (Applause.)As promised, I directed the Department of Defense to develop a plan to demolish and destroy ISIS -- a network of lawless savages that have slaughtered Muslims and Christians, and men, and women, and children of all faiths and all beliefs.  We will work with our allies, including our friends and allies in the Muslim world, to extinguish this vile enemy from our planet.  (Applause.)I have also imposed new sanctions on entities and individuals who support Iran's ballistic missile program, and reaffirmed our unbreakable alliance with the State of Israel.  (Applause.)Finally, I have kept my promise to appoint a justice to the United States Supreme Court, from my list of 20 judges, who will defend our Constitution.  (Applause.)  I am greatly honored to have Maureen Scalia with us in the gallery tonight.  (Applause.)  Thank you, Maureen.  Her late, great husband, Antonin Scalia, will forever be a symbol of American justice.  To fill his seat, we have chosen Judge Neil Gorsuch, a man of incredible skill and deep devotion to the law.  He was confirmed unanimously by the Court of Appeals, and I am asking the Senate to swiftly approve his nomination.  (Applause.)Tonight, as I outline the next steps we must take as a country, we must honestly acknowledge the circumstances we inherited.  Ninety-four million Americans are out of the labor force.  Over 43 million people are now living in poverty, and over 43 million Americans are on food stamps.  More than one in five people in their prime working years are not working.  We have the worst financial recovery in 65 years.  In the last eight years, the past administration has put on more new debt than nearly all of the other Presidents combined.We've lost more than one-fourth of our manufacturing jobs since NAFTA was approved, and we've lost 60,000 factories since China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001.  Our trade deficit in goods with the world last year was nearly $800 billion dollars.  And overseas we have inherited a series of tragic foreign policy disasters.Solving these and so many other pressing problems will require us to work past the differences of party.  It will require us to tap into the American spirit that has overcome every challenge throughout our long and storied history.  But to accomplish our goals at home and abroad, we must restart the engine of the American economy -- making it easier for companies to do business in the United States, and much, much harder for companies to leave our country.  (Applause.)Right now, American companies are taxed at one of the highest rates anywhere in the world.  My economic team is developing historic tax reform that will reduce the tax rate on our companies so they can compete and thrive anywhere and with anyone.  (Applause.)  It will be a big, big cut.   At the same time, we will provide massive tax relief for the middle class.  We must create a level playing field for American companies and our workers.  We have to do it.  (Applause.)  Currently, when we ship products out of America, many other countries make us pay very high tariffs and taxes.  But when foreign companies ship their products into America, we charge them nothing, or almost nothing.I just met with officials and workers from a great American company, Harley-Davidson.  In fact, they proudly displayed five of their magnificent motorcycles, made in the USA, on the front lawn of the White House.  ((Laughter and applause.)  And they wanted me to ride one and I said, ""No, thank you.""  (Laughter.)At our meeting, I asked them, how are you doing, how is business?  They said that it's good.  I asked them further, how are you doing with other countries, mainly international sales?  They told me -- without even complaining, because they have been so mistreated for so long that they've become used to it -- that it's very hard to do business with other countries because they tax our goods at such a high rate.  They said that in the case of another country, they taxed their motorcycles at 100 percent.  They weren't even asking for a change.  But I am.  (Applause.)I believe strongly in free trade but it also has to be fair trade.  It's been a long time since we had fair trade.  The first Republican President, Abraham Lincoln, warned that the ""abandonment of the protective policy by the American government… will produce want and ruin among our people.""  Lincoln was right -- and it's time we heeded his advice and his words.  (Applause.)  I am not going to let America and its great companies and workers be taken advantage of us any longer.  They have taken advantage of our country.  No longer.  (Applause.)I am going to bring back millions of jobs.  Protecting our workers also means reforming our system of legal immigration.  (Applause.)  The current, outdated system depresses wages for our poorest workers, and puts great pressure on taxpayers.  Nations around the world, like Canada, Australia and many others, have a merit-based immigration system.  (Applause.)  It's a basic principle that those seeking to enter a country ought to be able to support themselves financially.  Yet, in America, we do not enforce this rule, straining the very public resources that our poorest citizens rely upon.  According to the National Academy of Sciences, our current immigration system costs American taxpayers many billions of dollars a year.Switching away from this current system of lower-skilled immigration, and instead adopting a merit-based system, we will have so many more benefits.  It will save countless dollars, raise workers' wages, and help struggling families -- including immigrant families -- enter the middle class.  And they will do it quickly, and they will be very, very happy, indeed.  (Applause.)I believe that real and positive immigration reform is possible, as long as we focus on the following goals:  To improve jobs and wages for Americans; to strengthen our nation's security; and to restore respect for our laws.  If we are guided by the wellbeing of American citizens, then I believe Republicans and Democrats can work together to achieve an outcome that has eluded our country for decades.  (Applause.)Another Republican President, Dwight D. Eisenhower, initiated the last truly great national infrastructure program -- the building of the Interstate Highway System.  The time has come for a new program of national rebuilding.  (Applause.)America has spent approximately $6 trillion in the Middle East -- all the while our infrastructure at home is crumbling.  With this $6 trillion, we could have rebuilt our country twice, and maybe even three times if we had people who had the ability to negotiate.  (Applause.)To launch our national rebuilding, I will be asking Congress to approve legislation that produces a $1 trillion investment in infrastructure of the United States -- financed through both public and private capital -- creating millions of new jobs.  (Applause.)  This effort will be guided by two core principles:  buy American and hire American.  (Applause.)Tonight, I am also calling on this Congress to repeal and replace Obamacare -- (applause) -- with reforms that expand choice, increase access, lower costs, and, at the same time, provide better healthcare.  (Applause.)Mandating every American to buy government-approved health insurance was never the right solution for our country.  (Applause.)  The way to make health insurance available to everyone is to lower the cost of health insurance, and that is what we are going do.  (Applause.)Obamacare premiums nationwide have increased by double and triple digits.  As an example, Arizona went up 116 percent last year alone.  Governor Matt Bevin of Kentucky just said Obamacare is failing in his state -- the state of Kentucky -- and it's unsustainable and collapsing.One-third of counties have only one insurer, and they are losing them fast.  They are losing them so fast.  They are leaving, and many Americans have no choice at all.  There’s no choice left.  Remember when you were told that you could keep your doctor and keep your plan?  We now know that all of those promises have been totally broken.   Obamacare is collapsing, and we must act decisively to protect all Americans.  (Applause.)Action is not a choice, it is a necessity.  So I am calling on all Democrats and Republicans in Congress to work with us to save Americans from this imploding Obamacare disaster.  (Applause.)Here are the principles that should guide the Congress as we move to create a better healthcare system for all Americans:First, we should ensure that Americans with preexisting conditions have access to coverage, and that we have a stable transition for Americans currently enrolled in the healthcare exchanges.  (Applause.)Secondly, we should help Americans purchase their own coverage through the use of tax credits and expanded Health Savings Accounts -- but it must be the plan they want, not the plan forced on them by our government.  (Applause.)Thirdly, we should give our great state governors the resources and flexibility they need with Medicaid to make sure no one is left out.  (Applause.)Fourth, we should implement legal reforms that protect patients and doctors from unnecessary costs that drive up the price of insurance, and work to bring down the artificially high price of drugs, and bring them down immediately.  (Applause.)And finally, the time has come to give Americans the freedom to purchase health insurance across state lines -- (applause) -- which will create a truly competitive national marketplace that will bring costs way down and provide far better care.  So important.Everything that is broken in our country can be fixed.  Every problem can be solved.  And every hurting family can find healing and hope.Our citizens deserve this, and so much more -- so why not join forces and finally get the job done, and get it done right?  (Applause.)  On this and so many other things, Democrats and Republicans should get together and unite for the good of our country and for the good of the American people.  (Applause.)My administration wants to work with members of both parties to make childcare accessible and affordable, to help ensure new parents that they have paid family leave -- (applause) -- to invest in women's health, and to promote clean air and clean water, and to rebuild our military and our infrastructure.  (Applause.)True love for our people requires us to find common ground, to advance the common good, and to cooperate on behalf of every American child who deserves a much brighter future.An incredible young woman is with us this evening, who should serve as an inspiration to us all.  Today is Rare Disease Day, and joining us in the gallery is a rare disease survivor, Megan Crowley.  (Applause.)  Megan was diagnosed with Pompe disease, a rare and serious illness, when she was 15 months old.  She was not expected to live past five.  On receiving this news, Megan's dad, John, fought with everything he had to save the life of his precious child.  He founded a company to look for a cure, and helped develop the drug that saved Megan's life.  Today she is 20 years old and a sophomore at Notre Dame.  (Applause.)Megan's story is about the unbounded power of a father's love for a daughter.  But our slow and burdensome approval process at the Food and Drug Administration keeps too many advances, like the one that saved Megan's life, from reaching those in need.  If we slash the restraints, not just at the FDA but across our government, then we will be blessed with far more miracles just like Megan.  (Applause.)  In fact, our children will grow up in a nation of miracles.But to achieve this future, we must enrich the mind and the souls of every American child.  Education is the civil rights issue of our time.  (Applause.)  I am calling upon members of both parties to pass an education bill that funds school choice for disadvantaged youth, including millions of African American and Latino children.  (Applause.)  These families should be free to choose the public, private, charter, magnet, religious, or home school that is right for them.  (Applause.)Joining us tonight in the gallery is a remarkable woman, Denisha Merriweather.  As a young girl, Denisha struggled in school and failed third grade twice.  But then she was able to enroll in a private center for learning -- a great learning center -- with the help of a tax credit and a scholarship program.  Today, she is the first in her family to graduate, not just from high school, but from college.  Later this year she will get her master’s degree in social work.  We want all children to be able to break the cycle of poverty just like Denisha.  (Applause.)But to break the cycle of poverty, we must also break the cycle of violence.  The murder rate in 2015 experienced its largest single-year increase in nearly half a century.  In Chicago, more than 4,000 people were shot last year alone, and the murder rate so far this year has been even higher.  This is not acceptable in our society.  (Applause.)Every American child should be able to grow up in a safe community, to attend a great school, and to have access to a high-paying job.  (Applause.)  But to create this future, we must work with, not against -- not against -- the men and women of law enforcement.  (Applause.)  We must build bridges of cooperation and trust -- not drive the wedge of disunity and, really, it's what it is, division.  It's pure, unadulterated division.  We have to unify.  Police and sheriffs are members of our community.  They're friends and neighbors, they're mothers and fathers, sons and daughters -- and they leave behind loved ones every day who worry about whether or not they'll come home safe and sound.  We must support the incredible men and women of law enforcement.  (Applause.)And we must support the victims of crime.  I have ordered the Department of Homeland Security to create an office to serve American victims.  The office is called VOICE -- Victims of Immigration Crime Engagement.  We are providing a voice to those who have been ignored by our media and silenced by special interests.  (Applause.)  Joining us in the audience tonight are four very brave Americans whose government failed them.  Their names are Jamiel Shaw, Susan Oliver, Jenna Oliver, and Jessica Davis.Jamiel's 17-year-old son was viciously murdered by an illegal immigrant gang member who had just been released from prison.  Jamiel Shaw, Jr. was an incredible young man, with unlimited potential who was getting ready to go to college where he would have excelled as a great college quarterback.  But he never got the chance.  His father, who is in the audience tonight, has become a very good friend of mine.  Jamiel, thank you.  Thank you.  (Applause.)Also with us are Susan Oliver and Jessica Davis.  Their husbands, Deputy Sheriff Danny Oliver and Detective Michael Davis, were slain in the line of duty in California.  They were pillars of their community.  These brave men were viciously gunned down by an illegal immigrant with a criminal record and two prior deportations.  Should have never been in our country.Sitting with Susan is her daughter, Jenna.  Jenna, I want you to know that your father was a hero, and that tonight you have the love of an entire country supporting you and praying for you.  (Applause.)To Jamiel, Jenna, Susan and Jessica, I want you to know that we will never stop fighting for justice.  Your loved ones will never, ever be forgotten.  We will always honor their memory.  (Applause.)Finally, to keep America safe, we must provide the men and women of the United States military with the tools they need to prevent war -- if they must -- they have to fight and they only have to win.  (Applause.)I am sending Congress a budget that rebuilds the military, eliminates the defense sequester -- (applause) -- and calls for one of the largest increases in national defense spending in American history.  My budget will also increase funding for our veterans.  Our veterans have delivered for this nation, and now we must deliver for them.  (Applause.)The challenges we face as a nation are great, but our people are even greater.  And none are greater or braver than those who fight for America in uniform.  (Applause.)  We are blessed to be joined tonight by Carryn Owens, the widow of a U.S. Navy Special Operator, Senior Chief William ""Ryan"" Owens.  Ryan died as he lived:  a warrior and a hero, battling against terrorism and securing our nation.  (Applause.)  I just spoke to our great General Mattis, just now, who reconfirmed that -- and I quote -- ""Ryan was a part of a highly successful raid that generated large amounts of vital intelligence that will lead to many more victories in the future against our enemies.""  Ryan's legacy is etched into eternity.  Thank you.  (Applause.)  And Ryan is looking down, right now -- you know that -- and he is very happy because I think he just broke a record.  (Laughter and applause.)For as the Bible teaches us, ""There is no greater act of love than to lay down one's life for one's friends.""  Ryan laid down his life for his friends, for his country, and for our freedom.  And we will never forget Ryan.  (Applause.)To those allies who wonder what kind of a friend America will be, look no further than the heroes who wear our uniform.  Our foreign policy calls for a direct, robust and meaningful engagement with the world.  It is American leadership based on vital security interests that we share with our allies all across the globe.We strongly support NATO, an alliance forged through the bonds of two world wars that dethroned fascism, and a Cold War, and defeated communism.  (Applause.)But our partners must meet their financial obligations.  And now, based on our very strong and frank discussions, they are beginning to do just that.  In fact, I can tell you, the money is pouring in.  Very nice.  (Applause.)  We expect our partners -- whether in NATO, the Middle East, or in the Pacific -- to take a direct and meaningful role in both strategic and military operations, and pay their fair share of the cost.  Have to do that.We will respect historic institutions, but we will respect the foreign rights of all nations, and they have to respect our rights as a nation also.  (Applause.)  Free nations are the best vehicle for expressing the will of the people, and America respects the right of all nations to chart their own path.  My job is not to represent the world.  My job is to represent the United States of America. (Applause.)  But we know that America is better off when there is less conflict, not more.  We must learn from the mistakes of the past.  We have seen the war and the destruction that have ravaged and raged throughout the world -- all across the world.  The only long-term solution for these humanitarian disasters, in many cases, is to create the conditions where displaced persons can safely return home and begin the long, long process of rebuilding.  (Applause.)America is willing to find new friends, and to forge new partnerships, where shared interests align.  We want harmony and stability, not war and conflict.  We want peace, wherever peace can be found.  America is friends today with former enemies.  Some of our closest allies, decades ago, fought on the opposite side of these terrible, terrible wars.  This history should give us all faith in the possibilities for a better world.  Hopefully, the 250th year for America will see a world that is more peaceful, more just, and more free.On our 100th anniversary, in 1876, citizens from across our nation came to Philadelphia to celebrate America's centennial.  At that celebration, the country's builders and artists and inventors showed off their wonderful creations.  Alexander Graham Bell displayed his telephone for the first time.  Remington unveiled the first typewriter.  An early attempt was made at electric light.  Thomas Edison showed an automatic telegraph and an electric pen.  Imagine the wonders our country could know in America's 250th year.  (Applause.)Think of the marvels we can achieve if we simply set free the dreams of our people.  Cures to the illnesses that have always plagued us are not too much to hope.  American footprints on distant worlds are not too big a dream.  Millions lifted from welfare to work is not too much to expect.  And streets where mothers are safe from fear, schools where children learn in peace, and jobs where Americans prosper and grow are not too much to ask.  (Applause.)When we have all of this, we will have made America greater than ever before -- for all Americans.  This is our vision.  This is our mission.  But we can only get there together.  We are one people, with one destiny.  We all bleed the same blood.  We all salute the same great American flag.  And we all are made by the same God.  (Applause.)When we fulfill this vision, when we celebrate our 250 years of glorious freedom, we will look back on tonight as when this new chapter of American Greatness began.  The time for small thinking is over.  The time for trivial fights is behind us.  We just need the courage to share the dreams that fill our hearts, the bravery to express the hopes that stir our souls, and the confidence to turn those hopes and those dreams into action.From now on, America will be empowered by our aspirations, not burdened by our fears; inspired by the future, not bound by the failures of the past; and guided by our vision, not blinded by our doubts.  I am asking all citizens to embrace this renewal of the American spirit.  I am asking all members of Congress to join me in dreaming big, and bold, and daring things for our country.  I am asking everyone watching tonight to seize this moment.  Believe in yourselves, believe in your future, and believe, once more, in America.Thank you, God bless y"

Very important to all of us. This group has been fantastic, and many of which we were with yesterday and really developed something very special. So thank you. Thank you all for being here. Thank you, Mr. Vice President, also -- Mike, for being here.This is a very important moment, and a moment that means a great deal to me. This month has been a wonderful opportunity to celebrate African-American history, and to begin working together to create a better future for African-Americans and universities and colleges, and everything that is African-American. Today, we're taking action to help make that future happen and that future better.Historically Black Colleges and Universities are incredibly important institutions, woven into the fabric of our history just about like no other. Church is very important, right? Colleges and universities. Mike is my defender. (Laughter.) Education has the power to uplift. It has the power to transform. And, perhaps most important, education has the power to create greater equality and justice in our lives.That’s why today I'm thrilled to be signing an executive order to recognize the importance of Historically Black Colleges and Universities. Very important. They have played such an important role in achieving progress for African-Americans and in our nation’s march for justice. HBCUs have been really pillars of the African-American community for more than 150 years -- amazing job -- and a grand and enduring symbol of America at its absolute best. And I congratulate you all.With this executive order, we will make HBCUs a priority in the White House -- an absolute priority. (Applause.) A lot of people are going to be angry that they're not a priority, but that's okay. (Laughter.) And we will pledge our support to you, your mission, and to our shared mission of bringing education and opportunity to all of our people.And so I just want to congratulate -- these are very, very special people surrounding me. You've done an amazing job. It's not easy. Nothing is easy. But you've done an amazing job. And I just want to congratulate you all, and I want to thank you on behalf of our country.And so I'm goi
2017-02-28;https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/02/28/remarks-president-trump-signing-waters-united-states-wotus-executive;Remarks by President Trump at Signing of Waters of the United States (WOTUS) Executive Order;ell, thank you, everybody. We appreciate you being here. Thank you very much. First of all, I want to congratulate Scott Pruitt, who's here someplace. Where's Scott? (Applause.) So important. We're going to free up our country, and it's going be done in a very environmental and positive environmental way, I will tell you that, but create millions of jobs. So many jobs are delayed for so many years, and it's unfair to everybody. So I want congratulate Scott.I want to thank everyone for being here today. We have a great group of farmers, homebuilders, and county commissioners. They're all represented. They're standing alongside of me. I’d also like to thank Jim Inhofe, who's been so terrific in so many different ways, beyond even this. So I want thank Jim and also the leadership in the Senate on the issue, a friend of mine -- a great friend of mine -- John Barrasso.The EPA’s so-called “Waters of the United States” rule is one of the worst examples of federal regulation, and it has truly run amok, and is one of the rules most strongly opposed by farmers, ranchers and agricultural workers all across our land. It's prohibiting them from being allowed to do what they're supposed to be doing. It's been a disaster.The Clean Water Act says that the EPA can regulate “navigable waters” -- meaning waters that truly affect interstate commerce. But a few years ago, the EPA decided that “navigable waters” can mean nearly every puddle or every ditch on a farmer's land, or anyplace else that they decide -- right? It was a massive power grab. The EPA’s regulators were putting people out of jobs by the hundreds of thousands, and regulations and permits started treating our wonderful small farmers and small businesses as if they were a major industrial polluter. They treated them horribly. Horribly.If you want to build a new home, for example, you have to worry about getting hit with a huge fine if you fill in as much as a puddle -- just a puddle -- on your lot. I've seen it. In fact, when it was first shown to me, I said, no, you're kidding aren’t you? But they weren’t kidding.In one case in a Wyoming, a rancher was fined $37,000 a day by the EPA for digging a small watering hole for his cattle. His land. These abuses were, and are, why such incredible opposition to this rule from the hundreds of organizations took place in all 50 states. It's a horrible, horrible rule. Has sort of a nice name, but everything else is bad. (Laughter.) I've been hearing about it for years and years. I didn’t know I'd necessarily be in this position to do something about it, but we've been hearing about it for years.With today’s executive order, I’m directing the EPA to take action, paving the way for the elimination of this very destructive and horrible rule.So I want to thank everybody for being here. And I will sign wherever I'm supposed t
2017-02-27;https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/02/27/remarks-president-trump-meeting-national-governors-association;Remarks by President Trump in Meeting with the National Governors Association;"Thank you very much.  (Applause.)  That is pretty good, I'll tell you.  Coming from governors, I can't really -- I can't even believe it.  That's so impressive.  And I very much appreciate you being here.  And thank you to Vice President Pence.  He has been so wonderful to work with.  He's a real talent, a real guy.  And he is central casting, do we agree?  Central casting.  He's been great.  (Applause.)  Good morning, everybody, and welcome back to the White House.  The First Lady and I were very, very happy last night to host you.  We saw some real talent, military talent, musicians who were fantastic.  And everybody enjoyed it.  (Applause.)  I’m very proud to have so many former governors in my Cabinet.  Vice President Pence, as you know, big governor from a very great state -- I state I like very much -- Indiana.  Nikki Haley at the U.N. -- is Nikki here someplace?  I think so -- yes.  We have Rick Perry -- is going before.  We're trying to get people approved, we can't get them out.  But Rick is going to do a fantastic job.  Sonny Purdue will be joining the Cabinet very soon.  Terry Branstad will be our ambassador to China.  And an interesting story on Terry -- every time I spoke in Iowa, he'd say, please don’t say anything bad about China. (Laughter.)  I said, what do you mean?  What do you mean?  He said, I like China and we do a lot of business with China.  ""And really, just don’t"" -- and I said, ""hmm.""  So when it came down to picking an ambassador, I called him up, I said, you like China.  And I can tell you, China is very, very happy with our choice.  So we made everybody happy.  (Applause.)  Right?  These governors -- thank you.  And thank you, Terry.These governors have been bold reformers, and their success shows why we need to make states the laboratories of democracy once again.  Many of you have shared past frustrations with waiting for permission from the federal government and agencies -- and I understand that, and I've had many people tell me about it, and it's been catastrophic for some of your states.  You know your citizens and you know they want things done.  But they don’t get things done and it's not your fault.  Sometimes it's your fault, but they understand that.  But sometimes it's not your fault.  We're going to speed it up.  Because that's not how a partnership is supposed to work.  The government should not stand in your way in delivering needed reforms and services -- and it won't.  We're going to move very, very quickly, environmentally, with Scott and so many others that are involved in the process of regulation.  We are going to be cutting -- we're going to be doing the right thing.  We're going to be protecting people environmentally and safety-wise, but we're going to be moving it quickly, very quickly.  (Applause.)   And speaking of that, I know many of you -- and I've spoken to some of you last night about it -- have many projects that are -- I mean, just literally tied up because of environmental concerns, and it's been in for years and years and years the project your state wants, great for employment -- everybody wants them -- and they couldn’t get them out of environmental protection.  And we will get them out.  Now, that doesn’t mean they’re going to be approved, but they'll be rejected quickly one way or the other.  They'll be either rejected quickly or they're going to get approved.  I would say most will be approved, but you're going to know you're not going to wait nine years or eleven years -- some of the horror stories that I've heard.Under my administration, we're going to have a true partnership of collaboration and cooperation.  We will get to the answers and we will get them quickly, and the flexibility you need to implement the reforms that you are going to have in order to make decision-making proper and decision-making fast.  So we're going to do both those things -- proper and fast.  One of the most important responsibilities for the federal government is the budget of the United States.  My first budget will be submitted to the Congress next month.  This budget will be a public safety and national security budget, very much based on those two with plenty of other things, but very strong.  And it will include a historic increase in defense spending to rebuild the depleted military of the United States of America at a time we most need it.  (Applause.)    And you'll be hearing about that tomorrow night in great detail.  This is a landmark event, a message to the world, in these dangerous times, of American strength, security and resolve.  We must ensure that our courageous servicemen and women have the tools they need to deter war, and when called upon to fight in our name only do one thing:  Win.  We have to win.  We have to start winning wars again.  I have to say, when I was young, in high school and college, everybody used to say ""we haven’t lost a war"" -- we never lost a war -- you remember.  Some of you were right there with me, and you remember we never lost a war.  America never lost.  And now we never win a war.  We never win.  And we don’t fight to win.  We don’t fight to win.  So we either got to win, or don’t fight it at all.  But where we are -- 17 years -- almost 17 years of fighting in the Middle East.  I saw a chart the other day -- as of about a month ago, $6 trillion we've spent in the Middle East -- $6 trillion.  And I want to tell you, that's just unacceptable.  And we're nowhere.  Actually, if you think about it, we're less than nowhere.  The Middle East is far worse than it was 16, 17 years ago.  There's not even a contest.  So we've spent $6 trillion.  We have a hornet's nest.  It's a mess like you've never seen before.  We're nowhere.  So we're going to straighten it out.   This defense spending increase will be offset and paid for by finding greater savings and efficiencies across the federal government.  We’re going to do more with less.  I got involved in an airplane contract, I got involved in some other contracts, and we cut the hell out of the prices.  I mean, we saved a lot of money, tremendous amount of money, beyond anything that the generals that were involved -- they said they’d never seen anything like this before.On one plane, on a small order of one plane, I saved $725 million.  And I would say I devoted about, if I added it up, all those calls, probably about an hour.  So I think that might be my highest and best use.  (Laughter.)  Because if we can do that, our budget will be -- might be my highest and best.  (Applause.)  And there are many other places; it’s all the same.  And in one way, that's a good thing because we have an answer.  And David is going to do a fantastic job at the VA.  I see David is sitting there, shaking his head.  Stand up, David.  (Applause.)  So we can't get our people through Cabinet, but he went through -- was it 95 to nothing?SECRETARY SHULKIN:  A hundred to zero.  THE PRESIDENT:  How the hell did you do that?  (Laughter.)  Boy, oh boy.  He must be good.  You were the one.  One hundred to zero, wow.  Chose you -- hey, we can do it.  But we do -- we have still quite a few Cabinet members, and they're just in limbo waiting and waiting.  It’s like obstruction.  It’s obstruction.  But eventually we'll get them, and they'll put their people in, and we’ll get those agencies, et cetera, to work.We’re going to do more with less and make the government lean and accountable to the people.  We can do so much more with the money we spend.  With $20 trillion in debt -- can you imagine that -- the government must learn to tighten its belt, something families all across the country have had to learn to do, unfortunately.  But they've had to learn to do it, and they’ve done it well.  My budget increases spending, and the increase in all spending, for federal law enforcement also.  And activities having to do with law enforcement will be substantially increased.  And we will fight violent crime.  If you look at what’s happening in our cities, you look at what’s happening in Chicago, what’s going on in Chicago -- we will fight violent crime, and we will win.  And we’ll win that one fairly quickly.  Once we give the local police, the local law enforcement the right to go in and fight it, and we back them monetarily and also otherwise, we’re going to win that one.  We're going to win it fairly quickly, I believe.My budget also puts America first by keeping tax dollars in America to help veterans and first responders.  So important.  This budget follows through on my promise to focus on keeping Americans safe, keeping out terrorists, keeping out criminals, and putting violent offenders behind bars, or removing them from our country altogether.  And I must say that we’ve been treated very well -- very, very well -- on the job that General Kelly has done at the border.  It’s tough, it’s strong.  I was talking last night to Terry McAuliffe, and he said, you have to mention this -- because he met with -- where is Terry?  He’s around here someplace.  Terry -- he met with General Kelly, and I think I can say you were impressed with General Kelly.  And he said, you have to get the point out that they’re removing the bad ones.  And that’s where our focus is -- it’s the bad ones.  We’re getting some very, very bad players out of this country -- drug lords, gang members, heads of gangs, killers, murderers -- we’re getting them out.  That’s what we’re focused on.  The press isn’t covering that, unfortunately, but it’s something that is very important.  We’re getting the bad ones out.  And that’s always where I said I was going to start.  I was going to start with these bad players.  And they are bad.  They are rough and tough, and we’re getting them the hell out of our country, and we’re bringing them to where they started out.  Let their country do what they have to do with them.So the budget, which is going to be a very big part of tomorrow night’s speech, it’s going to be I think a budget of great rationality.  But it’s going to have to do with military, safety, economic development, and things such as that.  Great detail tomorrow night.We’re also going to do whatever we can to restore the authority of the states when that is the appropriate thing to do.  We’re going to give you back a lot of the powers that have been taken away from states and great people and great governors.  And you can control it better than the federal government because you’re right on top of it.  You have something that’s controllable.  So I think that’s going to be very important.  You see that already taking effect.  We have to let the states compete and to see who has the best solutions.  They know the best how to spend their dollars and how to take care of the people within each state.  And the states are different, and people are different.  So the governors are going to have a lot more decision-making ability than they have right now.All states will benefit from our economic agenda.  We will reduce taxes very, very substantially, and simplify the tax code.  We’re also going to make taxes between countries much more fair.  We’re one of the only countries in the world that people can sell their product into us and have no tax, no nothing, and they get rich.  And yet if you want to do business with them, you’ll have taxes, I’ve seen, as high as 100 percent.  So they sell into us, no problem; we sell into them -- because we don’t sell them because the tax is so high that they don’t want us to sell into them.  So I know that’s always been a point of contention, but to me it’s just fair.  It’s just fair.  It’s reciprocal.  It’s fair.  And so we’re going to be doing a lot of work on that, and that’s becoming a very, very important factor -- fairness.  Because I believe in free trade.  I want so much trade -- somebody said, oh, maybe he’s a total nationalist -- which I am, in a true sense -- but I want trade.  I want great trade between countries.  But the word “free” is very deceiving, because it’s good for them, it’s not good for us.  I want fair trade.  And if we’re going to be taxed, they should be taxed at the same amount, the other countries.  And one of two things is going to happen:  We’re going to make a lot of money or the other country is going to get rid of its tax.  And that’s good, too, because now the product, like Harley-Davidson -- I was talking to them -- the product will now flow into other countries where right now they can’t do it.So we’re going to make it easier for states to invest in infrastructure, and I'm going to have a big statement tomorrow night on infrastructure.  We spent $6 trillion in the Middle East, and we have potholes all over our highways and our roads.  I have a friend who is in the trucking business.  He said, my trucks are destroyed going from New York to Los Angeles.  They’re destroyed.  He said, I’m not going to get the good trucks.  He always prided himself on buying the best equipment.  He said, the roads are so bad that, by the time we make the journey from New York to Los Angeles or back, he said the equipment is just beat to hell.  I said, when has it been like that before?  He said, it’s never -- he’s been in the business for 40 years -- he said it’s never been like that.  Forty years -- never been like that.  So we’re going to take care of that.  Infrastructure -- we’re going to start spending on infrastructure big.  And it's not like we have a choice.  It’s not like, oh, gee, let’s hold it off.  Our highways, our bridges are unsafe.  Our tunnels -- I mean, we have tunnels in New York where the tiles are on the ceiling, and you see many tiles missing.  And you wonder, you know, you’re driving at 40 miles an hour, 50 miles an hour through a tunnel.  Take a look at the Lincoln Tunnel and the Queens-Midtown Tunnel, and you’re driving, and you see all this loose material that’s heavy.  And it was made many years ago, so it’s heavy.  Today, it’s light.  It used to be better.  The problem is, you got to hold it up.  And I say to myself -- every time I drive through, I say, I wonder how many people are hurt or injured when they are driving at 40, 50 miles an hour through a tunnel, and the tile falls off.  And there are so many missing tiles and such loose concrete.  So we have to fix our infrastructure.  It’s not like we have a choice.  We have no choice, and we’re going to do it, and it also happens to mean jobs, which is a good thing.  We’re going to repeal and replace Obamacare, and get states the flexibility that they need to make the end result really, really good for them.  A very complicated issue.  We have Tom Price, just got confirmed -- sitting here.  (Applause.)  Stand up, Tom.  And I spent a lot of time with Governor Walker and Governor Rick Scott the other day -- we were talking about it.  They’re really very expert on the subject, and I want to thank them.  They spent a lot of time with me.  Governor Christie who's here someplace.  Where's Chris?  Governor Christie, thank you.  And so we have a lot of talent and a lot of expertise here, I will tell you.  And we have come up with a solution that’s really, really, I think, very good.  Now, I have to tell you, it’s an unbelievably complex subject.  Nobody knew that healthcare could be so complicated.  And statutorily and for budget purposes, as you know, we have to do healthcare before we do the tax cut.  The tax cut is going to be major, it’s going to be simple, and the whole tax plan is wonderful.  But I can’t do it until we do healthcare because we have to know what the healthcare is going to cost.  And, statutorily, that’s the way it is.  So for those people that say, oh, gee, I wish we could do the tax first -- it just doesn’t work that way.  I would like to do that first.  It’s actually -- tax cutting has never been that easy, but it’s a tiny, little ant compared to what we’re talking about with Obamacare.  And you have to remember -- and I say this to Democrats in the room -- of which we have many -- Obamacare has failed.  If you go to Minnesota, where they had a 66-percent increase, and the governor of Minnesota, who is with us today, said, Obamacare -- the Affordable Care Act -- is no longer affordable -- something to that effect.  I think that might be it exactly.  But the Affordable Care Act is no longer affordable.  Obamacare has failed.  I say to the Republicans, if you really want to do politically something good, don’t do anything.  Sit back for a period of two years, because ’17 is going to be a disaster -- a disaster -- for Obamacare if we don’t do something.  Let it be a disaster because we can blame that on the Dems that are in our room, and we can blame that on the Democrats and President Obama.  Let it implode, and then let it implode in ’18 even worse.  Don’t do anything, and they will come begging for us to do something.  But that’s not the fair thing to do for the people.  It’s not the fair thing.  Politically, I think it would be a great solution, because as soon as we touch it, if we do the most minute thing -- just a tiny, little change -- what’s going to happen?  They’re going to say, it’s the Republicans’ problem.  That’s the way it is.  But we have to do what’s right because Obamacare is a failed disaster.  And it’s interesting, it’s sort of like, when you see -- you see it with politicians, you see it with President Obama -- when you know he's getting out of office and the clock is ticking, and he's not going to be there, his approval rating goes way up, even though, you know, not that active in the last period of time.  The approval rating goes up.  That’s not him; that's like almost everybody.  I see it happening with Obamacare.  People hate it, but now they see that the end is coming, and they're saying, oh, maybe we love it.  There’s nothing to love.  It’s a disaster, folks, okay?  So you have to remember that.And, very importantly, we are going to work to restore local control to our nation’s education system.  Betsy is here someplace, and she is going to be, I think, fantastic.  (Applause.)  I think she's going to be fantastic.  Stand up, Betsy.  Betsy feels so strongly, and she has had such support from so many people.  You know, you don’t see that too much because you see the anti, you never see the positive.  But I can tell you, I’ve had so many calls while she was going through that horrible process.  That was a tough, tough, nasty process.  And she hung in, she was as strong as you get.  But so many people were calling Betsy, saying you will do such a fantastic job once you get it.It’s like sometimes I'd say, it’s much tougher to get into Harvard than it is to stay there.  Does that make sense?  It’s tougher to get into the Wharton School of Finance -- you can’t get in.  But if you get in, it’s fine, you get through, right?  I think you’re going to do a fantastic job, and we’re very proud of you.  And you took a lot of heat, but you’re going to do great.  So she wants to bring decision-making powers back to parents, back to the families and back to the states, where they can really control education.  And just finally, I’m looking forward to working with you on these projects and so much more.  We’re going to do these projects and so many more.  And I thank you all again for being here.  It’s going to be a really productive discussion -- so productive that I’m going to ask the press to start leaving because I wouldn’t want them to see any great, productive session.  (Laughter.)  But they'll be seeing it and hearing about it.  Again, thank you very much all for being at the White House.  We’ll do this many times.  I want the opinions of the governors of the states of the United States.  So I want to just thank you all for being here, and let’s"
2017-02-27;https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/02/27/remarks-president-trump-listening-session-health-insurance-company-ceos;Remarks by President Trump in Listening Session with Health Insurance Company CEOs;"You are the big ones.  You are the biggest of the big, right?  (Laughter.)  That’s very impressive.  Thank you for being here.  We just had a great meeting with the governors on the horrible effects that Obamacare is having.  We’re going to change it and straighten it out, and make -- we have a plan that’s going to be, I think, fantastic.  It will be released fairly soon.  We’ll be talking about it tomorrow night during the speech.  But I think it’s going to be something special, and we’ll talk it about right here.  I think we’ll get you on, and I think you’re going to like what you hear.Again, thank you for being here.  I want to thank also Secretary Tom Price who’s with us, and who’s doing a phenomenal job on a very complex subject, the subject of healthcare.  He’s an advocate for the patients.  Tom is all about the patients.  That’s what he wants.  He wants to have a great healthcare system.Obamacare has been a disaster, and it’s only getting worse.  Last year alone, Obamacare premiums increased by double digits.  Since it has gone into effect, premiums are up by almost 100 percent in many areas.  And I think that this year it’s going to be really the year that I’ve always predicted -- ’17 is going to be a catastrophic year for Obamacare, for payments.  And you just take a look at what’s happening in various states like Arizona -- I believe it was up 116 percent; it’s going to be worse this year.Obamacare forced providers to limit the plan options they offered to patients and caused them to drive prices way up.  Now, a third of United States counties are down to one insurer, and the insurers are fleeing.  You people know that better than anybody.Since Obamacare went into effect, nearly half of the insurers are stopped and have stopped from participating in the Obamacare exchanges.  It has gotten so bad that nearly 20 million Americans have chosen to pay the penalty, or received an exemption rather than buy insurance.  That’s something that nobody has ever heard of or thought could happen, and they’re actually doing that rather than being forced to buy insurance.  We must work together to save Americans from Obamacare -- you people know that, and everyone knows that at this point -- to create more competition and to bring down the prices substantially.  The chaos that Obamacare has created, and for which congressional Democrats -- and you see that -- are alone and responsible for requires swift action.  I actually told the Republicans that if we did nothing, just do nothing for a two-year period, let Obamacare totally implode -- which it’s doing right now anyway -- that would be, from a political standpoint, the best thing we could do is to let it implode, and then people will come begging -- the Democrats will come begging to do something to help them out of the jam.Once we start doing it, we sort of inherit the problem, we take over the problem, it becomes ours.  But it’s the right thing to do for the American people.  I think allowing this to go on -- this disaster to go on -- is a mistake.  So I’m asking Secretary Price to work with you to stabilize the insurance markets and to ensure a smooth transition to the new plan.  And the new plan will be a great plan for the patients, for the people, and hopefully for the companies.  It's going to be a very competitive plan.  And costs will come down, and I think the healthcare will go up very, very substantially.  I think people are going to like it a lot.We’ve taken the best of everything we can take.  It’s our hope that Democrats will stop the obstruction and resistance.  And that’s what they have -- in fact, they have a sign, ""resist, resist.""  They want to resist everything, including Cabinet members.  I have many Cabinet members that haven’t been approved yet, people that are extraordinary -- all of whom are going to be approved, but they just take forever.  It’s called obstruct and resist.  Hope I didn’t give them a new phrase, because their real phrase is “resist.”  I think I just gave them another word.  I shouldn’t have done that.  I’m good at branding.  (Laughter.)  You’re going to see them now come out, “obstruct and resist.”  All right, well, at least I can take credit for it.  And they worked with us, and we are going to hopefully work with the Democrats, because ultimately we’re all people that love this country and we want to do the right thing, including reforms like expanded healthcare savings accounts, state flexibility, and the ability to purchase across state lines.  The state lines are so important for competition.  Everybody has wanted to do it for years.  What’s not to do?  So that’s going to be very important.I want to thank you all for being here.  I want to know and I want you to know that it’s an honor to do business with you.  It’s a great honor to have you in the White House.  And we look forward to providing healthcare that is that is extraordinary -- better than any other country anywhere in the world.  And we can do that.  We have the talent, we have the capacity, and we have the people. So we’ll work on that together.  And maybe before the press leaves, you can just introduce yourself and your company, and the public will get to see what you're about.  And then if things aren’t working out, I’m blaming you anyway.  (Laughter.) So we’ll start with Brad.MR. WILSON:  Thank you, Mr. President.  I appreciate the opportunity to be here.  I’m Brad Wilson, president and CEO of Blue Cross and Blue Shield of North Carolina, and pleased to represent our 3.9 million customers here today.THE PRESIDENT:  That's great, Brad.  Great job.MR.

I’m Joe Swedish with Anthem.  We're in 14 states, representing 40 percent of the American public.  We have 40 million members, and we've been involved in the individual (inaudible) for probably seven decades, and deeply embedded in the Affordable Care Act situation that has evolved over the last three years.  I don't want to miss the opportunity to thank you for the swift and decisive action that occurred most recently regarding some adjustments that have occurred in and around --THE PRESIDENT:  We had to step in.  MR. SWEDISH:  Thank you very much.THE PRESIDENT:  It was going to be an implosion.  We had to step in.  Thank you for saying that.MR. SWEDISH:  Thank you, sir.  Thank you.MR. TYSON:  I’m Bernard Tyson, chairman and CEO of Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, better known as Kaiser Permanente.  We cover 11.7 million Americans.  We also are an integrated delivery system, so we both provide the coverage and the care.  We have Permanente medical groups that contract exclusively with Kaiser Foundation Health Plan.  And we're proud to care for 11.7 million people. THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Bernard.MR. HILFERTY:  Mr. President, I’m Dan Hilferty.  I’m based in Philadelphia with Independence Blue Cross, Independence Health Group.  We're in 32 states and the District of Columbia and a large Medicaid managed care population.  We're the only player on the exchange in the five-county Philadelphia area.  And again, I’d like to echo Joe’s point.  We were thrilled with the initial steps to stabilize the market.  We look forward to working with you, Vice President Pence, Secretary Price in making sure that we have a sustainable program for years to come.  So thank you.THE PRESIDENT:  Well, thank you very much.  And the market, as you know, and we talk about stabilizing the market -- the market is disastrous.  It’s going to absolutely implode.  That's why we're meeting today.  And I think we're going to come up with something where not only will the market be great, but the people are going to be taken care of.  So we will work that out I think quite easily, a"

I want to just congratulate the First Lady on having done a really beautiful job.  The room, they say, has never looked better, but who knows.  I’m sure it’s looked very good many times.  So, Melania, congratulations.  (Applause.) I also want to congratulate and thank a truly great Vice President of the United States, and his wonderful wife, Karen.  And wherever you are, Mike, stand up just for a second.  Mike Pence.  (Applause.) So I can say that after four weeks -- they were a lot of fun -- but we’ve accomplished almost everything we’ve started out to accomplish.  The borders are stricter, tighter.  We’re going a really good job.  General Kelly has does a fantastic job militarily.  As you know, we have a fantastic team.  We have an A team.  And I’m getting some good reports.  There are some big problems in the world -- you know that very well -- but we’re very happy with the way things are working.  And again, we’ve made a lot of promises over the last two years, and many of those promises already are kept.  So we’re very honored by that.  And I -- (applause) -- thank you, thank you.  I just want to salute and toast the governors -- the great governors of the United States.  They have done an amazing job.  Such an easy job you have.  (Laughter.)  So easy.  But you have done a fantastic job, and your families and wives and -- well, everybody is here.  I mean, I’ve seen daughters come tonight.  I’ve seen wives.  I’ve seen -- all I know is, everybody is lovely, and we’re going to have a wonderful evening.  And tomorrow, we’re going to meet, and we’re going to discuss things, like perhaps healthcare will come up.  Perhaps.  (Laughter.)  And I think we’ve made a lot of progress on that.  And we’re going to have a speech on Tuesday night, and we’re going to be speaking very specifically about a very complicated subject.  Everybody is different, every state is different, and different requirements, but I think we have something that's going to really be excellent.  And as most of you know, the Obamacare has had tremendous problems.  I won’t say in front of the Democrats, I’ll just say it to the Republicans -- (laughter) -- it doesn’t work.  But we’re going to have it fixed, and we’re going to repeal and replace.  And I think you’re going to see something very, very special.  And for all of you, and even tonight, because we have Tom Price with us -- if you see something or want to discuss it, we don’t have to discuss all friendly stuff.  We can discuss a little bit of the healthcare.  We might as well start.  But tomorrow morning, we’re going to meet and have some pretty big sessions on healthcare and other things -- whatever is on your mind.  So I hear this is a record number of governors -- 46.  And that’s the highest number that have ever shown up for this evening.  (Applause.)  So, with that, I would like to toast the great, great governors of the United States.  Thank you.  (A toast is offered.) Now, I know it’s inappropriate, but I’d like to ask a friend of mine -- I’ve just destroyed his political career -- (laughter) -- from the other side, a man from Virginia -- I’ve known him a long time, and he's a very good guy -- Governor Terry McAuliffe to come up and also, perhaps, make a toast.  Thank you.  Terry, where are you?  Come on up, Terry.  (Applause.)  GOVERNOR MCAULIFFE:  Well, good evening.  Let me, first of all, on behalf of our nation’s governors, I want to thank the President and the First Lady.  We have found out this is the first big social dinner of the calendar, and I think they did that out of respect to our nation’s governors.  So if we give a great round of applause to the President and the First Lady.  (Applause.) Now, Mr. President, as you know, I am chairman of the National Governors Association, so I’m not sure if the 46 -- the largest crowd ever -- is due to my chairmanship or your presidency.  (Laughter.)  But tonight, in the spirit of bipartisanship, sir, we will both take credit for the greatest NGA meeting in the history of NGA meetings.  (Applause.) I also want to thank the Vice President of the United States and Mrs. Pence.  On Friday, for the first time ever, they opened the Vice Presidential Mansion -- the Naval Observatory -- to host the governors for lunch.  That had never been done before.  So if we could give a great round of applause to the Vice President and Karen Pence.  (Applause.) And let me just say, tomorrow we’re all going to meet, we’re going to discuss the issues tomorrow, but the one thing we all agree on -- all of us governors and this administration, what every governor wants -- we want good jobs.  We want a good economy.  We want the world-class education system in our respective states.  We want a healthcare delivery system that works, with great, quality healthcare, efficiently at a low cost.  We want people to get on our roads and our rail, and be able to ride around efficiently, and then go see their kids play a ballgame.  That’s what we all want.  And, Mr. President, I thank you for having us here tonight.  We have a common goal:  We are the greatest nation in the globe.  And I want to toast to you, Mr. President, and just say, we want to work with you to build on those ideals that have instilled and brought all of us governors together, that we can respectively grow our states and grow our nation to be truly the great destiny that we are.  So I would like to offer a toast to the President of

Thank you very much.First of all, I want to thank Matt Schlapp, and his very, very incredible wife and boss, Mercedes, who have been fantastic friends and supporters, and so great.  When I watch them on television defending me, nobody has a chance.  So, I want to thank Matt and Mercedes.  And when Matt called and asked, I said, absolutely, I'll be there with you.  I mean, the real reason I said it -- I didn’t want him to go against me because that one you can’t beat.  So I said, absolutely.  And it really is an honor to be here.I wouldn't miss a chance to talk to my friends.  These are my friends.  (Applause.)  And we’ll see you again next year and the year after that, and I’ll be doing this with CPAC whenever I can, and I’ll make sure that we’re here a lot.You know, if you remember, my first major speech -- sit down, everybody.  Come on.  (Applause.)  You know, the dishonest media, they’ll say he didn’t get a standing ovation.  You know why?  No, you know why?  Because everybody stood and nobody sat, so they will say he never got a standing ovation, right?  (Applause.)  They are the worst.AUDIENCE:  USA! USA! USA!  (Applause.) THE PRESIDENT:  So -- sit down.  (Laughter.)  Donald Trump did not get a standing ovation.  They leave out the part, they never sat down.  They leave that out.  So I just want to thank -- but you know, my first major speech was at CPAC.  And probably five or six years ago -- first major political speech.  And you were there.And it was -- I loved it.  I love the people.  I love the commotion.  And then they did these polls where I went through the roof, and I wasn’t even running, right?  But it gave me an idea, and I got a little bit concerned when I saw what was happening in the country, and I said, let’s go do it.  So it was very exciting.  I walked the stage on CPAC.  I’ll never forget it, really.  I had very little notes, and even less preparation.  So when you have practically no notes and no preparation, and then you leave and everybody was thrilled, I said, I think I like this business.I would have come last year, but I was worried that I would be, at that time, too controversial.  We wanted border security.  We wanted very, very strong military.  We wanted all of the things that we’re going to get, and people consider that controversial.  But you didn’t consider it controversial.  (Applause.) So I’ve been with CPAC for a long time.  All of these years, we've been together.  And now you finally have a president.  Finally.  Took you a long time.  Took you a long time.  (Applause.) And it’s patriots like you that made it happen, believe me -- believe me.  You did it because you love your country, because you want a better future for your children, and because you want to make America great again.  (Applause.) The media didn't think we would win.  AUDIENCE MEMBER:  They knew. (Laughter.)THE PRESIDENT:  The pundits -- you’re right.  They had an idea.  The pundits didn't think we would win.  The consultants that suck up all that money.  Oh, they suck it up, they’re so good.  (Laughter.)  They’re not good at politics, but they’re really good at sucking up people’s money.  Especially my opponent’s, because I kept them down to a minimum.THE PRESIDENT:  But the consultants didn’t think we would win.  But they all underestimated the power of the people -- you.  And the people proved them totally wrong.  Never -- and this is so true, and this is what’s been happening -- never underestimate the people.  Never.  I don’t think it will ever happen again.And I want you all to know that we are fighting the fake news.  It’s fake -- phony, fake.  (Applause.)  A few days ago, I called the fake news “the enemy of the people” -- and they are.  They are the enemy of the people.  Because they have no sources, they just make them up when there are none.  I saw one story recently where they said nine people have confirmed.  There are no nine people.  I don’t believe there was one or two people.  Nine people.  And I said, give me a break.  Because I know the people.  I know who they talked to.  There were no nine people.  But they say, nine people, and somebody reads it and they think, oh, nine people.  They have nine sources.  They make up sources.They are very dishonest people.  In fact, in covering my comments, the dishonest media did not explain that I called the fake news the enemy of the people -- the fake news.  They dropped off the word “fake.”  And all of the sudden, the story became, the media is the enemy.  They take the word “fake” out, and now I’m saying, oh, no, this is no good.  But that’s the way they are.  So I’m not against the media.  I’m not against the press.  I don’t mind bad stories if I deserve them.  And I tell you, I love good stories, but we won’t -- (laughter) -- I don’t get too many of them.But I am only against the fake news media or press -- fake, fake.  They have to leave that word.  I'm against the people that make up stories and make up sources.  They shouldn’t be allowed to use sources unless they use somebody’s name.  Let their name be put out there.  Let their name be put out.  (Applause.)  A source says that Donald Trump is a horrible, horrible human being.  Let them say it to my face.  (Applause.)  Let there be no more sources.  And remember this -- and in not all in all cases.  I mean, I had a story written yesterday about me in Reuters by a very honorable man.  It was a very fair story.  There are some great reporters around.  They’re talented, they’re honest as the day is long.  They’re great.  But there are some terrible, dishonest people, and they do a tremendous disservice to our country and to our people.  A tremendous disservice.  They are very dishonest people, and they shouldn’t use sources.  They should put the name of the person.  You will see stories dry up like you’ve never seen before.So you have no idea how bad it is, because if you are not part of the story -- and I put myself in your position sometimes, because many of you, you’re not part of the story, and if you’re not part of the story, then you sort of know.  If you are part of the story, you know what they’re saying is true or not.  So when they make it up, and they make up something else, and you saw that before the election -- polls, polls.  The polls.  They come out with these polls, and everybody was so surprised.  Actually, a couple of polls got it right.  I must say, Los Angeles Times did a great job.  Shocking, because -- you know.  They did a great job.  (Applause.)  And we had a couple of others that were right.But generally speaking, I mean, I can tell you the network.  Somebody said a poll came out.  And I say, what network is it?  And they’ll say, a certain -- let’s not even mention names right?  Should we?Well, you have a lot of them.  Look, the Clinton new network is one.  (Applause.)  Totally.  Take a look.  Honestly.  Take a look at their polls over the last two years.  Now, you would think they would fire the pollster, right?  After years and years of getting battered.  But I don’t -- I mean, who knows, maybe they’re just bad at polling.  Or maybe they’re not legit.  But it’s one or the other.  Look at how inaccurate -- look at CBS, look at ABC also.  Look at NBC.  Take a look at some of these polls.  They’re so bad, so inaccurate.  And what that does is it creates a false narrative.  It creates like this narrative that’s just like we’re not going to win, and people say, ""Oh, I love Trump, but you know I’m not feeling great today.  He can’t win.  So I won’t go and vote.  I won’t go and vote.""  It creates a whole false deal and we have to fight it folks.  We have to fight it.  They’re very smart, they’re very cunning, and they’re very dishonest.So just to conclude -- I mean, it’s a very sensitive topic, and they get upset when we expose their false stories.  They say that we can't criticize their dishonest coverage because of the First Amendment.  You know, they always bring up the First Amendment.  (Laughter.)  And I love the First Amendment.  Nobody loves it better than me.  Nobody.  (Applause.)  I mean, who uses it more than I do?But the First Amendment gives all of us -- it gives it to me, it gives it to you, it gives all Americans -- the right to speak our minds freely.  It gives you the right and me the right to criticize fake news, and criticize it strongly.  (Applause.)  And many of these groups are part of the large media corporations that have their own agenda, and it’s not your agenda, and it’s not the country’s agenda.  It’s their own agenda.  They have a professional obligation as members of the press to report honestly.  But as you saw throughout the entire campaign, and even now, the fake news doesn’t tell the truth.  Doesn’t tell the truth.So just in finishing, I say it doesn’t represent the people.  It never will represent the people.  And we’re going to do something about it, because we have to go out and we have to speak our minds, and we have to be honest.  Our victory was a win like nobody has ever seen before.  (Applause.)  And I’m here fighting for you, and I will continue to fight for you.  The victory and the win were something that really was dedicated to a country and people that believe in freedom, security, and the rule of law.  (Applause.)  Our victory was a victory and a win for conservative values.  (Applause.)  And our victory was a win for everyone who believes it’s time to stand up for America, to stand up for the American worker, and to stand up for the American flag.  (Applause.)  Yeah, there we should stand up.  Come on.  (Applause.)  There we should stand up.  Okay.  (Applause.)And, by the way, we love our flag.  By the way, you folks are in here, the place is packed -- there are lines that go back six blocks.  And I tell you that because you won’t read about it, okay?  (Laughter.)  But there are lines that go back six blocks.  There is such love in this country for everything we stand for.  You saw that on Election Day.  (Applause.)  And you’re going to see it more and more.  (Applause.)  So we’re all part of this very historic movement, a movement the likes of which, actually, the world has never seen before.  There’s never been anything like this.  There’s been some movements, but there’s never been anything like this.  There’s been some movements that petered out, like Bernie -- petered out.  (Laughter.)  But it was a little rigged against him -- superdelegate, superdelegate.  She had so many delegates before the thing even started.  I actually said to my people, how does that happen?  (Laughter.)  Not that I’m a fan of Bernie, but a lot of Bernie people voted for Trump.  You know why?  Because he’s right on one issue:  Trade.  He was right about trade.Our country is being absolutely devastated with bad trade deals.  So he was right about that, but we’ve got a lot of Bernie support.  So actually, I like Bernie, okay?  I like Bernie.  (Applause.)  But I’m here today to tell you what this movement means for the future of the Republican Party and for the future of America.  First, we need to define what this great, great unprecedented movement is, and what it actually represents.  The core conviction of our movement is that we are a nation that put and will put its own citizens first.  (Applause.)  For too long we’ve traded away our jobs to other countries -- so terrible.  We’ve defended other nations’ borders while leaving ours wide open; anybody can come in.  AUDIENCE MEMBER:  A wall!THE PRESIDENT:  Oh, we’re going to build the wall, don’t worry about it.  We’re building the wall.  We’re building the wall.  In fact, it’s going to start soon, way ahead of schedule, way ahead of schedule.  (Applause.)  Way, way, way ahead of schedule.  It’s going to start very soon.  General Kelly, by the way, has done a fantastic job.  Fantastic job he’s done.  (Applause.)  And remember, we are getting the bad ones out.  These are bad dudes.  We’re getting the bad ones out, okay?  We’re getting the bad -- if you watch these people it’s like, oh, gee, that’s so sad.  We’re getting bad people out of this country, people that shouldn’t be -- whether it’s drugs or murder or other things.  We’re getting bad ones out.  Those are the ones that go first, and I said it from day one.  Basically all I’ve done is keep my promise.  (Applause.)  We’ve spent trillions of dollars overseas while allowing our own infrastructure to fall into total disrepair and decay.  In the Middle East, we’ve spent as of four weeks ago $6 trillion.  Think of it.  And, by the way, the Middle East is in what -- I mean, it’s not even close -- it’s in much worse shape than it was 15 years ago.  If our Presidents would have gone to the beach for 15 years, we would be in much better shape than we are right now, that I can tell you.  (Applause.)  Yeah, a hell of a lot better.  We could have rebuilt our country three times with that money.  This is the situation that I inherited.  I inherited a mess, believe me.  We also inherited a failed health care law that threatens our medical system with absolute and total catastrophe.Now, I’ve been watching -- and nobody says it -- but Obamacare doesn’t work, folks.  I mean, I could say -- I could talk -- it doesn’t work.  And now people are starting to develop a little warm heart, but the people that you’re watching, they’re not you.  They’re largely -- many of them are the side that lost.  You know, they lost the election.  It’s like, how many elections do we have to have?  They lost the election.  (Laughter.)  But I always say, Obamacare doesn’t work.  And these same people two years, and a year ago, were complaining about Obamacare.  And the bottom line:  We’re changing it.  We’re going to make it much better.  We’re going to make it less expensive.  We’re going to make it much better.  Obamacare covers very few people.And remember, deduct from the number all of the people that had great health care that they loved, that was taken away from them; was taken away from them.  (Applause.)  Millions of people were very happy with their health care.  They had their doctor, they had their plan.  Remember the lie -- 28 times.  “You can keep your doctor, you can keep your plan” -- over and over and over again you heard it.  So we’re going to repeal and replace Obamacare.  (Applause.)  And I tell Paul Ryan and all of the folks that we’re working with very hard -- Dr. Tom Price, very talented guy -- but I tell them from a purely political standpoint, the single-best thing we can do is nothing.  Let it implode completely -- it’s already imploding.  You see the carriers are all leaving.  I mean, it’s a disaster.But two years don’t do anything.  The Democrats will come to us and beg for help.  They’ll beg, and it’s their problem.  But it’s not the right thing to do for the American people.  It’s not the right thing to do.  (Applause.) We inherited a national debt that has doubled in eight years.  Think of it -- $20 trillion.  It’s doubled.  And we inherited a foreign policy marked by one disaster after another.  We don’t win anymore.  When was the last time we won?  Did we win a war?  Do we win anything?  Do we win anything?  We’re going to win.  We’re going to win big, folks.  We’re going to start winning again, believe me.  We’re going to win.  (Applause.)  AUDIENCE:  USA!  USA!  USA!THE PRESIDENT:  But we’re taking a firm, bold and decisive measure -- we have to -- to turn things around.  The era of empty talk is over.  It’s over.  (Applause.)  Now is the time for action.  So let me tell you about the actions that we’re taking right now to deliver on our promise to the American people, and on my promise to make America great again.We’ve taken swift and strong action to secure the southern border of the United States and to begin the construction of great, great border wall.  (Applause.)  And with the help of our great border police, with the help of ICE, with the help of General Kelly and all of the people that are so passionate about this -- our Border Patrol, I’ll tell you what they do.  They came and endorsed me, ICE came and endorsed me.  They never endorsed a presidential candidate before.  They might not even be allowed to.  (Laughter.)  But they were disgusted with what they saw. And we’ll stop it.  We’ll stop the drugs from pouring into our nation and poisoning our youth.  (Applause.)  Pouring in, pouring in.  We get the drugs, they get the money.  We get the problems, they get the cash.  No good, no good.  Going to stop. By stopping the flow of illegal immigration, we will save countless tax dollars, and that's so important because the tax -- the dollars that we're losing are beyond anything that you can imagine.  And the tax dollars that can be used to rebuild struggling American communities -- including our inner cities.  (Applause.)We are also going to save countless American lives.  As we speak today, immigration officers are finding the gang members, the drug dealers and the criminal aliens, and throwing them the hell out of our country.  (Applause.)  And we will not let them back in.  They're not coming back in, folks.  (Applause.)  If they do, they're going to have bigger problems than they ever dreamt of.I'm also working with the Department of Justice to begin reducing violent crime.  I mean, can you believe what's happening in Chicago, as an example?  Two days ago, seven people were shot --AUDIENCE MEMBER:  It's Iraq!THE PRESIDENT:  -- and, I believe, killed.  Seven people.  Seven people.  Chicago, a great American city.  Seven people shot and killed.  We will support the incredible men and women of law enforcement.  (Applause.)  Thank you.  And thank them.  I've also followed through on my campaign promise and withdrawn America from the Trans-Pacific Partnership -- (applause) -- so that we can protect our economic freedom.  And we are going to make trade deals, but we're going to do one-on-one, one-on-one.  And if they misbehave, we terminate the deal.  And then they'll come back, and we'll make a better deal.  (Applause.)  None of these big quagmire deals that are a disaster.  Just take a look -- by the way, take a look at NAFTA, one of the worst deals ever made  by any country having to do with economic development.  It's economic undevelopment as far as our country is concerned. We're preparing to repeal and replace the disaster known as Obamacare.  (Applause.)  We're going to save Americans from this crisis, and give them the access to the quality healthcare they need and deserve.We have authorized the construction, one day, of the Keystone and Dakota Access pipelines.  (Applause.)  And issued a new rule.  This took place while I was getting ready to sign.  I said, who makes the pipes for the pipeline?  Well, sir, it comes from all over the world, isn't that wonderful?  I said, nope, it comes from the United States or we're not building one.  (Applause.)  American steel.   If they want a pipeline in the United States, they're going to use pipe that's made in the United States, do we agree?  (Applause.)But can you imagine -- I told this story the other day -- can you imagine the gentleman -- never met him, don't even know the name of his company.  I actually sort of know it, but I want to get it exactly correct.  Big, big, powerful company.  They spent hundreds of millions of dollars on the pipeline -- same thing with the Dakota, different place.  They got their approvals, everything, in the case of Dakota, then all of a sudden they couldn't connect it because they had people protesting that never showed up before.But with the Keystone -- so they spend hundreds of millions of dollars with bloodsucker consultants, you know, sucking the blood out of the company -- ""don't worry, I use them all my life; okay, don't worry, we're going to get it approved, I'm connected, I'm a lobbyist, don't worry.""  Bottom line, Obama didn't sign it.  Could be 42,000 jobs -- somewhere around there.  A lot of jobs.  Didn't sign it.  But can you imagine -- he gave up.  A year ago it was dead.  Now he's doing nothing, calling his wife, ""Hello, darling, I'm a little bored, you know that pipeline?""  That has killed us, that has killed our company.  Knock, knock.  ""Mr. so-and-so, the Keystone pipeline, sir, out of nowhere, has just been approved.""  (Applause.)  Now, can you imagine the expression?  And you know the sad part?  The same bloodsucking consultants that hit him for all the money and failed?  They're now going to go back to him and say, didn't we do a great job?  We want more money, right, because that's the way the system works.  A little bit off, but that's the way the system works.We're preparing bold action to lift the restrictions on American energy, including shale, oil, natural gas, and beautiful clean coal, and we're going to put our miners back to work.  (Applause.)  Miners are going back to work.  (Applause.)  Miners are going back to work, folks.  Sorry to tell you that, but they're going back to work.  We have begun a historic program to reduce the regulations that are crushing our economy -- crushing.  And not only our economy, crushing our jobs, because companies can't hire.  We're going to put the regulation industry out of work and out of business.  (Applause.)  And, by the way, I want regulation.  I want to protect our environment.  I want regulations for safety.  I want all of the regulations that we need, and I want them to be so strong and so tough.  But we don't need 75 percent of the repetitive, horrible regulations that hurt companies, hurt jobs, make us noncompetitive overseas with other companies from other countries.  That, we don't need.  But we're going to have regulations.  It's going to be really strong and really good, and we're going to protect our environment, and we're going to protect the safety of our people and our workers.  (Applause.)Another major promise is tax reform.  We are going to massively lower taxes on the middle class, reduce taxes on American business, and make our tax code more simple and much more fair for everyone, including the people and the business.  (Applause.)In anticipation of these and other changes, jobs are already starting to pour back into our country -- you see that.  In fact, I think I did more than any other pre-President -- they say President-elect.  President-elect is meeting with Ford, he's meeting with Chrysler, he's meeting with General Motors.  I just wanted to save a little time.  (Laughter.)  Because Ford and Fiat-Chrysler, General Motors, Sprint, Intel and so many others are now, because of the election result, making major investments in the United States, expanding production and hiring more workers.  And they're going back to Michigan, and they're going back to Ohio, and they're going back to Pennsylvania, and they're going back to North Carolina, and to Florida.  (Applause.)It's time for all Americans to get off of welfare and get back to work.  You're going to love it!  You're going to love it.  You are going to love it.  (Applause.)We're also putting in a massive budget request for our beloved military.  (Applause.)  And we will be substantially upgrading all of our military -- all of our military.  Offensive, defensive, everything.  Bigger and better and stronger than ever before.  And hopefully, we'll never have to use it.  But nobody is going to mess with us, folks.  Nobody.  (Applause.)It will be one of the greatest military buildups in American history.  No one will dare to question -- as they have been, because we're very depleted, very, very depleted.  Sequester.  Sequester.  Nobody will dare question our military might again.  We believe in peace through strength, and that's what we will have.  (Applause.)  As part of my pledge to restore safety for the American people, I have also directed the defense community to develop a plan to totally obliterate ISIS.  (Applause.)  Working with our allies, we will eradicate this evil from the face of the Earth.  (Applause.)At the same time, we fully understand that national security begins with border security.  Foreign terrorists will not be able to strike America if they cannot get into our country.  (Applause.)  And by the way, take a look at what's happening in Europe, folks.  Take a look at what's happening in Europe.  I took a lot of heat on Sweden.  (Laughter.)  And then a day later, I said, has anybody reported what's going on?  And it turned out that they didn't -- not too many of them did.  (Laughter.)  Take a look at what happened in Sweden.  I love Sweden.  Great country.  Great people.  I love Sweden.  But they understand I'm right.  The people over there understand I'm right.  Take a look at what's happening in Sweden.  Take a look at what's happening in Germany.  Take a look at what's happened in France.  Take a look at Nice and Paris.  I have a friend -- he's a very, very substantial guy.  He loves the City of Lights.  He loves Paris.  For years, every year, during the summer, he would go to Paris -- it was automatic -- with his wife and his family.  I hadn’t seen him in a while.  And I said, Jim, let me ask you a question:  How’s Paris doing?  ""Paris?  I don’t go there anymore.  Paris is no longer Paris.""  That was four years -- four, five years -- hasn’t gone there.  He wouldn’t miss it for anything.  Now he doesn’t even think in terms of going there.  Take a look at what’s happening to our world, folks, and we have to be smart.  We have to be smart.  We can’t let it happen to us.  (Applause.) So let me state this as clearly as I can:  We are going to keep radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of our country.  (Applause.)  We will not be deterred from this course, and in a matter of days, we will be taking brand new action to protect out people and keep America safe.  You will see the action.  (Applause.) I will never, ever apologize for protecting the safety and security of the American people.  I won’t do it.  (Applause.)  If it means I get bad press, if it means people speak badly of me, it’s okay.  It doesn’t bother me.  The security of our people is number one -- is number one.  (Applause.)  Our administration is running with great efficiency, even though I still don’t have my Cabinet approved.  Nobody mentions that.  Do you know I still have people out there waiting to be approved?  And everyone knows they're going to be approved.  It’s just a delay, delay, delay.  It’s really sad.  It’s really sad.  And these are great people.  These are some great people.  We still don’t have our Cabinet.  I assume we’re setting records for that.  That’s the only thing good about it is we’re setting records.  I love setting records.  (Applause.)  But I hate having a Cabinet meeting and I see all these empty seats.  I said, Democrats, please, approve our Cabinet and get smart on health care too, if you don’t mind.  (Applause.) But we’re taking meetings every day with top leaders in business, in science, and industry.  Yesterday, I had 29 of the biggest business leaders in the world in my office -- Caterpillar tractor, Campbell’s Soup.  We had everybody.  We had everybody.  I like Campbell’s Soup.  (Laughter and applause.)  We had everybody, and we came to a lot of very good conclusions, and a lot of those folks that are in that room are going to be building big, big massive new plants, and lots of jobs.  And you know what?  They’re going to be building them in this country, not in some other country.  (Applause.) We’re meeting with unions, meeting with law enforcement, and we’re meeting with leaders from all around the world, where the White House doors used to be totally closed -- they were closed, folks.  You don’t realize that.  They were closed.  They’re now wide open.  And they’re open for people doing business for our country and putting people to work.  (Applause.) And when they come into the White House, we’re translating these meetings into action.  One by one, we’re checking off the promises we made to the people of the United States.  One by one -- a lot of promises.  And we will not stop until the job is done.  We will reduce your taxes.  We will cut your regulations.  We will support our police.  We will defend our flag.  (Applause.)  We will rebuild our military.  We will take care of our great, great veterans.  We’re taking care of our veterans.  (Applause.) We will fix our broken and embarrassing trade deals that are no good -- none of them.  You wonder, where did the people come from that negotiated these deals?  Where did they come from?AUDIENCE MEMBER:  Government.THE PRESIDENT:  Well, they came also from campaign contributions, I must be honest with you.  They’re not as stupid as you think.  (Laughter.) We will cut wasteful spending.  We will promote our values.  We will rebuild our inner cities.  We will bring back our jobs and our dreams.  So true.  (Applause.)  So true.And, by the way, we will protect our Second Amendment.  (Applause.)  You know, Wayne and Chris are here from the NRA, and they didn’t have that on the list.  It’s lucky I thought about it.  (Laughter.)  But we will indeed.  And they’re great people.  And by the way, they love our country.  They love our country.  The NRA has been a great supporter.  They love our country.The forgotten men and women of America will be forgotten no longer.  That is the heart of this new movement and the future of the Republican Party.  People came to vote, and these people -- the media -- they said, where are they coming from?  What’s going on here?  These are hardworking, great, great Americans.  These are unbelievable people who have not been treated fairly.  Hillary called them “deplorable”.  They’re not deplorable.AUDIENCE:  Booo -- lock her up!  Lock her up!  Lock her up!THE PRESIDENT:  Who would have thought that a word was going to play so badly.  That’s the problem in politics.  One wrong word and it’s over.  She also said irredeemable, but we won’t mention that.  The GOP will be, from now on, the party also of the American worker.  (Applause.)  You know, we haven’t been, as a group, given credit for this, but if you look at how much bigger our party has gotten during this cycle.  During the early days when we had 17 people running -- the primaries -- millions and millions of people were joining.  Now, I won’t say it was because of me, but it was, okay.  (Applause.) And we have an amazing, strong, powerful party that truly does want to see America be great again, and it will see it.  And it’s going to see it a lot sooner than you think, believe me.  A lot sooner than you think.  (Applause.) We will not answer to donors or lobbyists or special interests, but we will serve the citizens of the United States of America, believe me.  Global cooperation -- dealing with other countries, getting along with other countries -- is good.  It’s very important.  But there is no such thing as a global anthem, a global currency, or a global flag.  This is the United States of America that I’m representing.  I’m not representing the globe.  I’m representing your country.  (Applause.) AUDIENCE:  USA! USA! USA! THE PRESIDENT:  There is one allegiance that unites us all, and that is to America.  America -- it’s the allegiance to America.No matter our background, or income, or geography, we are all citizens of this blessed land.  And no matter our color, or the blood, the color of the blood we bleed, it’s the same red blood of great, great patriots.  Remember.  Great patriots.  (Applause.) We all salute, with pride, the same American Flag.  And we are equal -- totally equal -- in the eyes of Almighty God.  We’re equal.  (Applause.)  Thank you.And I want to thank, by the way, the evangelical community, the Christian community.  (Applause.)  Communities of faith -- rabbis and priests and pastors, ministers -- because the support for me was a record, as you know, not only in terms of numbers of people, but percentages of those numbers that voted for Trump.  So I want to thank you folks.  It was amazing -- an amazing outpouring, and I will not disappoint you.  As long as we have faith in each other, and trust in God, then there is no goal, at all, beyond our reach.  There is no dream too large, no task too great.  We are Americans, and the future belongs to us.  The future belongs to all of you.  (Applause.)  And America is coming about, and it’s coming back, and it’s roaring and you can hear it.  It’s going to be bigger and better.  It is going to be.  It is going to be.  Remember.  And it’s roaring.  It’s going to be bigger, and better, and stronger than ever before.  (Applause.) I want to thank you.  And Matt and Mercedes, I want to thank the two of you, and all of the supporters that I have.  I see them.  They’re all over the place.  You are really great people.  I want to thank you.And I want to say to you, God bless you, and God bless the United States of A"
2017-02-24;https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/02/24/remarks-president-trump-signing-executive-order-regulatory-reform;Remarks by President Trump at Signing of Executive Order on Regulatory Reform;Thank you all very much for being here.  We have tremendous people standing behind me, and the biggest in the world in terms of manufacturing and business.  Some of the people involved are Ken Fisher and Ken Frazier, Chairman and President, CEO of Merck.  Alex Gorsky, Chairman, CEO of Johnson and Johnson.  Marillyn Hewson -- and she has been very tough to deal with but that’s okay -- (laughter) -- she’s a very tough negotiator, President of Lockheed Martin.  Gregory Hayes, Chairman and CEO, United Technology.  Andrew Liveris, my friend Andrew, Chairman and CEO of Dow Chemical Company.  Mario Longhi, the President, CEO, United States Steel Corporation.  Juan Luciano, Chairman, President, CEO of Archer Daniels Midland Company.  Denise Morrison, President of Campbell’s Soup Company.  Lee Styslinger III, Chairman and CEO of Altec, Inc.  Mark Sutton, Chairman, CEO of International Paper.  And Inge Thulin, Chairman, President of 3M Company.And we have made tremendous progress with these great business leaders -- amazing progress.  They’re getting together in groups and they’re coming up with suggestions about their companies and how to bring jobs back to the United States.  And I think it will be a fantastic day for the country. And we met yesterday, and -- I met with these folks and some more.  Excessive regulation is killing jobs, driving companies out of our country like never before.  Although, I must say, I think we’ve stopped it to a large part, Marillyn, right?MS. HEWSON:  Right.THE PRESIDENT:  Reducing wages and raising prices.  I’ve listened to American companies and American workers.  I’ve been listening to them for a long time.  I’ve been listening to them complain for a long time.  But today, this executive order directs each agency to establish a regulatory reform task force, which will ensure that every agency has a team of dedicated -- and a real team of dedicated people to research all regulations that are unnecessary, burdensome and harmful to the economy, and therefore harmful to the creation of jobs and business.Each task force will make recommendations to repeal or simplify existing regulations.  The regulatory burden is for the people behind me and for the great companies of this country, and for small companies -- an impossible situation, we’re going to solve it very quickly.  They will also have to really report every once in a while to us so we can report on the progress, and so we can come up with some even better solutions.This executive order is one of many ways we’re going to get real results when it comes to removing job-killing regulations and unleashing economic opportunity.  We’ve already issued an order which says that for every one new regulation, two old regulations must be eliminated.  So that in itself is going to be tremendous, but what we’re doing is much more than even that.Every regulation should have to pass a simple test:  Does it make life better or safer for American workers or consumers?  If the answer is no, we will be getting rid of it and getting rid of it quickly.  We will stop punishing companies for doing business in the United States.  It’s going to be absolutely just the opposite.  They’re going to be incentivized for doing business in the United States.We’re working very hard to roll back the regulatory burdens so that coal miners, factory workers, small-business owners, and so many others can grow their businesses and thrive.  We cannot allow government to be an obstacle to government opportunity.  We are going to bring back jobs and create more opportunities to prosper, maybe more than ever before in our country.  We’ve made tremendous strides over the last short period of time.  This is -- I guess we’re four weeks into it.  I think for four weeks I’ve done a good job, wouldn’t you say?  (Laughter.)  But again, I want to thank these great business leaders.  Some of them are with us and the White House, and they’ve had tremendous success -- Reed and Jared and so many others -- in business.  And they’re helping us sort out what’s going on, because really, for many years, even beyond -- long beyond Obama, President Obama -- I will say that it’s been disastrous for business.  This is going to be a place for business to do well and to thrive.And so with the signing of this executive order, I would like to just congratulate everybody behind me.  And, Andrew, I’d like to thank you for initially getting the group together.  MR. LIVERIS:  Thank you.  Thank you, Mr. President.THE PRESIDENT:  Really a fantastic job you’ve done.  MR. LIVERIS:  Thank you. (The executive order is signed.) THE PRESIDENT:  Should I give this pen to Andrew?  Dow Chemical.  (Laughter.)  I think maybe, right?  (Applause.)  MR LIVERIS:  Thank you.  THE PRESIDENT:  That means a lot o
2017-02-23;https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/02/23/remarks-president-trump-meeting-manufacturing-ceos;Remarks by President Trump in Meeting with Manufacturing CEOs;"Well, thank you very much.  It's a great honor to have everybody.  And some of the great people in the world of business, many of you I know -- many of you I know from reading all of our wonderful magazines and business magazines, in particular.  So it's an honor to have you with us today.Bringing manufacturing back to America, creating high-wage jobs was one of our campaign promises and themes, and it resonated with everybody.  It was really something what happened.  States that hadn’t been won in many, many years were -- they came over to our fold.  A lot of it had to do with the jobs, and other reasons -- but jobs.  And I'm delivering on everything that we've said.  In fact, people are saying they've never seen so much happen in 30 days of a presidency.  We've delivered on a lot.  And I think Mark can explain, and Mark can probably say some of the things we're doing for the auto industry.  We're going to be doing for many of the industries.As you know, the United States lost one-third of our manufacturing jobs since NAFTA.  That's an unbelievable number and statistic.  And 70,000 factories closed since China joined the WTO -- 70,000 factories.  So when I used to give that statistic, I used to talk about and I always thought it was a typo.  I said, it has to be a typo.  I tell Wilbur -- Wilbur, that can't be right -- 70,000.  Think of it, 70,000 factories.  So you say, what are we doing?  My administration's policies and regulatory reform, tax reform, trade policies will return significant manufacturing jobs to our country.  Everything is going to be based on bringing our jobs back, the good jobs, the real jobs.  They've left, and they're coming back.  They have to come back.You've already seen companies such as Intel, Ford.  Mark has been great.  GM, Walmart, Amgen, Amazon, Fiat -- they came the other day; they're going to make a tremendous investment in the country.  Carrier and many others announced significant new investments in the United States.  For example, Ford is doing 700 million in Michigan, creating 700 new jobs -- is a vote of confidence.  It was actually stated a vote of confidence.  We have many other companies doing the same thing.  Carrier, as you know -- and I got involved very late, almost like by two years late -- but many of the jobs that were leaving for Mexico, they're bringing back at least 800 jobs they're bringing back.  And they actually never got to leave.  I have no idea what they did with the plant in Mexico, but we'll have to ask them, because it was largely built.General Motors is investing $1 billion in U.S. plants, adding or keeping 7,000 jobs.  And it's going to be investing a lot more than that over the next fairly short period.  Lockheed Martin has -- they've just announced 1,800 new jobs, and U.S. plants are doing a great job, and we started negotiating with them a little bit on the F-35.  They cut their price a little bit.  Thank you very much.  She's tough.  (Laughter.)  But it worked out well I think for everybody.  And I think I have to say this:  Marillyn, you've gotten a lot of credit, because what you did was the right thing.  So we appreciate it.  She cut her price over $700 million, right?  By over $700 million.  You think Hillary would have asked for $700 million?  (Laughter.)  Oh, boy, I hope you -- I assume you wanted her to win.  But you know what?  You're going to do great and you're going to make more planes.  It's going to work out the same, or better.Walmart announced plans to create 10,000 jobs, and all of those jobs are going to be in the United States.  Sprint and SoftBank is putting in $50 billion because of our election in the United States, over the next four years, to create 50,000 jobs.  They've been terrific, by the way.  And we have many others.  Many of you are in the room, and you know exactly what I'm talking about.  We have many, many other companies.  And we're very happy.Today we have 24 CEOs from the largest manufacturing companies in the country and even in the world.  They represent people just in this room, nearly $1 trillion of sales and 2 million employees, large majorities of which are in the United States.  They share our commitment to bringing manufacturing back and to create jobs in this country, which has been the biggest part of my campaign.  I would say the border, a big part.  Military strength, big part.  And jobs, big part.  I don’t want to say which is most important.  I guess we always have to say defense is maybe the most important.  But many of you take care of our defense, you make great products.  Nobody makes the products that we do for our military.  Nobody.  And, in fact, a couple of countries who were not allowed to buy from us, I gave them -- hello, Jeff -- I gave them authorization -- you can only buy from us.  I want them to buy from us.  They were getting planes from other countries because our -- and they’re allies.  But they’re going to be buying from us from now on.And I just want to thank all of my people.  My staff has been amazing.  Gary, as you know -- you all know Gary from Goldman, Gary Cohn.  And we’re really happy -- just paid $200 million in tax in order to take this job, by the way.  (Laughter.)  Which is very much unlike Gary.  But he’s great.  And he’ll be criticized by the media because he’s getting paid $197,000.  They’ll say he really wanted that money -- which he gave up.  I think he gave up -- did you give that up, Gary?  I think so. MR. COHN:  Yes.PARTICIPANT:  It was one of those things.THE PRESIDENT:  It was one of those things.  That’s right.  (Laughter.)  I want to thank -- Wilbur has been so fantastic.  I’ve known Wilbur for so long, and he’s a great guy, great negotiator, but a very fair negotiator.  And he’s going to be doing things that -- the deals we have with other countries are unbelievably bad.  We don’t have any good deals.  In fact, I’m trying to find a country where we actually have a surplus of trade as opposed to -- everything is a deficit.With Mexico, we have $70 billion in deficits, trade deficits, and it’s unsustainable.  We’re not going to let it happen.  Can’t let it happen.  We’re going to have a good relationship with Mexico, I hope.  And if we don’t, we don’t.  But we can’t let that happen -- $70 billion in trade deficits.  And that doesn’t include the drugs that pour across the border, like water.  So we can’t let that happen.With China, we have close to a $500-billion trade deficit.  So we have to do something.  I spoke to the President, I spoke to many people.  We’re going to work on that very, very hard, and we’re going to do things that are the proper things to do.  But I actually said to my people:  Find a country where we actually do well.  So far, we haven’t found that country.  It’s just losses with everybody, and we’re going to turn that around.I want to thank Jared Kushner, who has been so involved in this, and all of my guys.   We have a great team.  We have a team of all-stars.  And we’ve been credit -- we’ve really been given credit for that.  Right now, Rex, who, as you know, he’s in Mexico -- I said, that’s going to be a tough trip, because we have to be treated fairly by Mexico.  That’s going to be a tough trip.  But he’s over there with General Kelly, who’s been unbelievable at the border.  You see what’s happening at the border.  All of a sudden for the first time we’re getting gang members out, we’re getting drug lords out.  We’re getting really bad dudes out of this country and at a rate that nobody has ever seen before.  And they’re the bad ones.And it’s a military operation because what has been allowed to come into our country -- when you see gang violence that you’ve read about like never before and all of the things -- much of that is people that are here illegally.  And they’re rough and they’re tough, but they’re not tough like our people.  So we’re getting them out.I thought what we could do is maybe we’ll start with Ken on my left, and we’ll go around the room and introduce yourselves to the press.  Lots of media.  One thing, we have lots of media.  How are you?  Treats me -- that’s one that treats me very nicely, one of the few.  Hi.  And we’ll just start around -- go around the room and then we’ll talk privately without the press, and we’re going to figure out how to bring many, many millions of jobs more back to the United States, okay?Ken, go ahead.MR. FRAZIER:  Thank you, Mr. President, it’s good to be here.  Ken Frazier from Merck & Co., Inc.MR. FIELDS:  Thank you, Mr. President.  Mark Fields, CEO of Ford Motor Company.MS. MORRISON:  Thank you, Mr. President.  Denise Morrison from Campbell Soup Company.THE PRESIDENT:  Good soup.MS. MORRISON:  Thank you.MR. HAYES:  Thank you, Mr. President.  Greg Hayes from United Technologies, the parent company of Carrier. THE PRESIDENT:  Did you bring any more of those jobs back from Carrier?  (Laughter.)  But one thing he did -- you know, I told -- I said, you were given so much credit for that, and I heard, two days ago, that you’re selling far more Carrier air conditioners than you thought, just as a patriotic move.  People are buying Carrier because of what you did -- bringing the jobs back to Indiana.MR. HAYES:  That’s exactly right.  It’s a great success.THE PRESIDENT:  Right?  So, I said that.  I thought that was going to happen.  Good.  Thank you.MR. STYSLINGER:  Thank you, Mr. President.  Lee Styslinger with Altec, Inc.MR. GORSKY:  Thank you, Mr. President.  Alex Gorsky with Johnson & Johnson.MR. FARR:  Thank you, Mr. President.  David Farr with Emerson.  St. Louis.MR. OBERHELMAN:  Doug Oberhelman, executive chairman of Caterpillar.  We have plenty of D10s available for you.THE PRESIDENT:  I love those D10s.  (Laughter.)  I even like the D12.  Are they still doing the D12?MR. OBERHELMAN:  We’re doing a D11, and we have some of those around as well.THE PRESIDENT:  Because the D12, I’m waiting for, you know.  That’s going to be bigger than anything ever in history, right?  But there’s nothing like what you do.  The Caterpillars are the best.MR. OBERHELMAN:  Thank you.THE PRESIDENT:  And when we raise the dollar, and we let other people manipulate their currencies, it’s the one thing that stops you, Doug -- right?MR. OBERHELMAN:  Well, we’ll take them on.  Bring them on.THE PRESIDENT:  Right, technology.  No, but we have to give you a level playing field.MR. OBERHELMAN:  We need a level playing field.THE PRESIDENT:  We have to let other countries give you a level playing field.  So, what a great company.  I love Caterpillar.  I’ve been driving them for a long time.MR. OBERHELMAN:  Well, come out and see us, and we’ll put you in one.  (Laughter.) THE PRESIDENT:  Okay, good.  I might do that soon.  Go ahead.MR. KAMSICKAS:  Jim Kamsickas, Dana Incorporated. Thank you.MR. LONGHI:  Mario Longhi, with U.S. Steel, Mr. President.  Thank you for the opportunity.THE PRESIDENT:  And you’re going to be doing pipelines now.  You know that, right?  We put you heavy into the pipeline business because we approved, as you know, the Keystone Pipeline and Dakota.  But they have to buy -- meaning, steel, so I’ll say U.S. Steel -- but steel made in this country and pipelines made in this country.MR. LONGHI:  100 percent, Mr. President.  We’ll be there.THE PRESIDENT:  So the pipe is coming from the U.S.  MR. LONGHI:  By the way, when you come drive trucks, come up to Minnesota and our mines.  You’re going to see us running up there.THE PRESIDENT:  Good.  I’ll do it.  I’ll be out there.MR. FETTIG:  Mr. President, thank you.  Jeff Fettig, Whirlpool Corporation.THE PRESIDENT:  Yep, good.MS. HEWSON:  Thank you, Mr. President.  Marillyn Hewson, Lockheed Martin Corporation.  I just want to thank you for this opportunity that we’ve spent this morning in the working groups, and the opportunity to talk to you today about generating jobs.  We’re very excited about the fact that this is one of the first actions that you want to take on.  So thank you very much.THE PRESIDENT:  Good.  Well, thank you, and thank you for what we did.  Lot 10, we call it.  Lot 10 -- 90 planes.  It was 90 planes out of 3,000, but it was not doing so well, and now it’s doing great.  Right?MS. HEWSON:  That’s right, Mr. President.THE PRESIDENT:  Okay, good.MS. HEWSON:  And we welcome you to Fort Worth to see those aircraft on the production line.THE PRESIDENT:  Good.  Very good.  Thank you, Marillyn.MR. IMMELT:  Mr. President, good to see you again.  Jeff Immelt with GE.THE PRESIDENT:  Good.  Hi, Jeff.MR. IMMELT:  Great to be here.  Look forward to really working you on creating more manufacturing jobs.THE PRESIDENT:  Jeff actually watched me make a hole-in-one, can you believe that?  Should you tell that story?MR. IMMELT:  We were trying to talk President Trump into doing ""The Apprentice.""  That was my assignment when we owned NBC.  President Trump goes up to a par 3 on his course, he looks to the three of us and says, “You realize of course I’m the richest golfer in the world.”  That’s a comment, then gets a hole-in-one.  (Laughter.)THE PRESIDENT:  Crazy.MR. IMMELT:  I have to say, you know, I’ve seen the magic before.  (Laughter.)THE PRESIDENT:  It’s so crazy that -- no, I actually said I was the best golfer of all the rich people -- (laughter) -- to be exact.  And then I got a hole-in-one.MR. IMMELT:  That’s what you said.THE PRESIDENT:  So, it was sort of cool.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.MR. BROWN:  Thank you, Mr. President.  Bill Brown from Harris Corporation.

This will be somewhat of an informal meeting.  I want to congratulate Mick Mulvaney, who’s been confirmed finally -- we waited a long time -- by the Senate.  And he’s going to be an absolutely great director.  Total confidence in Mick.  Known him for a long time.  He loves those budgets.  Unfortunately, the budget we’re inheriting -- essentially inheriting -- is a mess.  The finances of our country are a mess.  But we’re going to clean them up.  Things that we’ve been doing, including negotiating deals that have already been negotiated, so you call it re-negotiating -- on airplanes and lots of other things, military items -- we’ll end up either getting many more planes free, or we’re going to save a lot of money.  But we’ve already saved a lot; billions and billions of dollars have been saved.We have enormous work to do as the national debt doubled over the last eight years.  Our debt has doubled over a short period of time.  I want the American people to know that our budget will reflect their priorities.  We’ll be directing all of our departments and agencies to protect every last American and every last tax dollar.  No more wasted money.We’re going to be spending the money in a very, very careful manner.  Our moral duty to the taxpayer requires us to make our government leaner and more accountable.  We must do a lot more with less.  And we must stop the improper payments and the abuses, negotiate better prices, and look for every last dollar of savings.We’ve already imposed hiring freezes on nonessential government workers, and part of our commitment is to continue to do that for the American taxpayer.  We have appointed a Cabinet that knows how to manage dollars wisely.  I’ve known many of the folks for a long time.  They’ve been tremendous winners -- whether it’s Steve or Gary or another Steve, right here.  And that’s why I will direct them to manage the country’s dollars and your dollars very wisely.  We won’t let your money be wasted anymore.  We’re going to run government smoothly, efficiently, and on behalf of the very hardworking taxpayers -- something that the taxpayers haven’t seen in a long time.  I will be holding everybody accountable for that, and I have no doubt that this group -- in particular, this group will do a fantastic job.  I want to congratulate Steve Mnuchin as our new Secretary of the Treasury.  He’s going to be outstanding.  Tremendous track record -- he has a tremendous track record.  I have great confidence in him.So we’re going to continue on, and we’re going to take this budget, which is -- in all fairness, I’ve only been here for four weeks, so I can’t take too much of the blame for what’s happened.  But it is absolutely out of control, and we’re going to do things that are going to be tremendous over the years.  We have to take care of our military.  We have no choice, we have to take care of our military.  It needs work; it’s very depleted.  And we have to take care of a lot of other things. Healthcare is moving along nicely.  It’s being put into final forms.  As you know, before we do the tax -- which is actually very well finalized -- but we can’t submit it until the healthcare, statutorily or otherwise.  So we’re doing the healthcare.  Again, moving along very well.  Sometime during the month of March, maybe mid- to early March we will be submitting something that I think people will be very impressed by.And with that, we’re going to have a little meeting.  And I think the press knows pretty much all of the people at "

McMaster to National Security Advisor ;So I just wanted to announce -- we've been working all weekend very diligently, very hard -- that General H.R. McMaster will become the National Security Advisor.  He's a man of tremendous talent and tremendous experience.  I watched and read a lot over the last two days.  He is highly respected by everybody in the military.  And we're very honored to have him.  He also has also known for a long time General Keith Kellogg, who I also have gotten to know and he's a terrific man, and they're going to be working together.  And Keith is going to be Chief of Staff, and I think that combination is something very, very special.I met with many other people.  Tremendous respect for the people I met with.  I know John Bolton we're going to be asking to work with us in a somewhat different capacity.  John is a terrific guy.  We had some really good meetings with him.  He knows a lot.  He has a good number of ideas that I must tell you I agree very much with.  So we'll be talking to John Bolton in a different capacity.  And we’ll be talking to some of the other generals that I've met that I have really, really paid a lot of respect for.So I think with that, I'd like to ask H.R. to say a couple of words.  I'd like to ask Keith to say a couple of words.  And then I'll see you back in Washington.  We're leaving right now for Washington and the White House.  General.LT. GENERAL MCMASTER:  Mr. President, thank you very much.  I'd just like to say what a privilege it is to be able to continue serving our nation.  I'm grateful to you for that opportunity, and I look forward to joining the National Security team and doing everything I can to advance and protect the interests of the American people.  Thank you very much, sir.THE PRESIDENT:  You're going to do a great job.LT. GENERAL MCMASTER:  Thank you, sir.THE PRESIDENT:  General.LT. GENERAL KELLOGG:  Mr. President, thank you for the opportunity to serve.  I'm very honored by it and privileged by it.  And I'm very honored and privileged to serve alongside H.R. McMaster, who I've known for years as well.  He's a great statesman, he's a great soldier.  Thank you, sir.THE PRESIDENT:  And so are you.  Thank you very much.  What a privilege.  This is a great team.  We're very, very honored.  Our country is lucky to have two people like this.  And, frankly, after having met so many of the people in the military, we're lucky to have all of them.  So thank you all very much.  I'll see you back in Washington.  We're leaving now.  Thank you.Q    Did Vice President Pence play

Remember we came down -- all together, we came down, and this was going to be a place that was tough to win, and we won in a landslide.  This was a good one.  (Applause.)  So I want to thank the people of South Carolina and your governor -- tremendous guy.  He supported us right from the beginning.  So I'd like to thank Governor McMaster for the incredible job.  He's right here someplace.  Thank you very much.  You have been fantastic.And I have to say also, that is one beautiful airplane.  (Applause.)  Congratulations to the men and women here who have built it.  What an amazing piece of art.  What an amazing piece of work.  Thank you, Dennis, for the invitation to be with you today.  You know, in the old days, when I made this speech I got paid a lot of money.  Now I have to do it for nothing.  (Laughter and applause.)  Not a good deal, but that's okay.  We love it.It’s wonderful to be back in South Carolina, especially with your new governor.  Where is Henry?  He's around here someplace.  Where is he?  Stand up, Henry.  Proud of you.  He helped us so much.  (Applause.) And I want to also thank your former governor, Nikki Haley, who is doing an awfully good job for us.  (Applause.)  She's representing America very well as our ambassador to the United Nations.  She is doing a spectacular job.  It's early, but she has just been really great.We're here today to celebrate American engineering and American manufacturing.  We're also here today to celebrate jobs.  Jobs.  (Applause.)  This plane, as you know, was built right here in the great state of South Carolina.  Our goal as a nation must be to rely less on imports and more on products made right here in the U.S.A.  (Applause.)It’s amazing to think that a little over 113 years ago, next door, in North Carolina, Orville Wright was the first man to sail the skies in a very little airplane.  The 1903 Wright Flyer was made of mostly wood and cloth.  It was so small that Orville's brother, Wilbur, could not join him on the flight.  He was always very upset about that.  The flight lasted all of 12 seconds, but it was incredible.  That flight was a testament to the American spirit.  I see that same spirit everywhere I travel in the country.  I saw that spirit all throughout the campaign.  We have the greatest people anywhere in the world.  We have the greatest spirit, and you just look at what's going on today in our country -- you look at what's happening with jobs.  You look at what's happening with plants moving back into our country.  All of a sudden, they're coming back.  And they're going to be very happy about it, believe me.  (Applause.)  They're going to be very, very happy.  (Applause.)As your President, I am going to do everything I can to unleash the power of the American spirit and to put our great people back to work.  (Applause.)  This is our mantra: Buy American and Hire American.  (Applause.) We want products made in America, made by American hands.  You probably saw the Keystone pipeline I approved recently, and the Dakota.  And I’m getting ready to sign the bill.  I said, where is the pipe made?  And they told me not here.  I said, that's good -- add a little sentence that you have to buy American steel.  (Applause.)  And you know what?  That's the way it is.  It’s the way it’s going to be. We are going to fight for every last American job.  We’ve come a long way since the Wright Brothers and their first flight more than a century ago.  Your plane is made of carbon fiber.  It seats 330 passengers.  It’s 18 feet longer than the previous version of the 787.  And this airplane can fly for half a day before it touches the ground.  The name says it all: Dreamliner.  Great name.  Our country is all about making dreams come true.Over the last number of years, that hasn’t been necessarily the case, but we're going to make it the case again.  (Applause.) That’s what we do in America –- we dream of things, and then we build them.  We turn vision into reality, and we will be doing a lot more of that, believe me, in the months and years to come.  (Applause.) I also want to say a word to all of the members of the armed forces who are here with us today in this record crowd.  (Applause.)    South Carolina has a long, very, very, proud military tradition and history.  We salute all South Carolina military families, and we salute all the men and women who wear the uniform.  (Applause.)We are going to fully rebuild our military -- by the way, do you care if we use the F-18 Super Hornets?  (Applause.)  Or do you only care about -- what do you think?  Well -- (jet flies overhead) -- thought that was a Super Hornet.  (Laughter.)  We are looking seriously at a big order, and we’ll see how that -- you know the problem is that Dennis is a very, very tough negotiator.  (Laughter.)  But I think we may get there.We're also working on the Air Force One project, which was a difficult project for previous administrations.  But it looks like we're getting closer and closer.  (Applause.) And we’re going to ensure that our great service members have the tools, equipment, training and resources they need to get the job done.  (Applause.)  As George Washington said, being prepared for war is the best way to prevent it.  And that's really what it is:  The best way to prevent war, being prepared.  Peace through strength.  We build a military might so great -- and we are going to do that -- that none will dare to challenge it.  None.  (Applause.) We will ensure our men and women in uniform have the latest, the most cutting edge systems in their arsenal.  Right now it’s not that way.  It will be that way very, very soon.  Believe me.  You will be an important player in this effort.Boeing has built many important aircraft -- including, as I said, the F-18 Super Hornet, the F-15 Strike Eagle, and the Apache helicopter, just to name a few.  (Applause.)  And I’m being very, very serious -- the new Air Force One, that plane, as beautiful as it looks, is 30 years old.  Can you believe it?  What can look so beautiful at 30?  An airplane. (Laughter.)  I don't know.  Which one do we like better folks?  Tell me.  (Applause.)On every front, we are going to work for the American people.  Nowhere in our focus -- and I mean this so strongly -- and our focus has to be so strong, but my focus has been all about jobs.  And jobs is one of the primary reasons I’m standing here today as your President, and I will never, ever disappoint you.  Believe me.  I will not disappoint you.  (Applause.) I campaigned on the promise that I will do everything in my power to bring those jobs back into America.  We wanted to make much easier -- it has to be much easier to manufacture in our country and much harder to leave.  I don't want companies leaving our country, making their product, selling it back, no tax, no nothing, firing everybody in our country.  We're not letting that happen anymore, folks.  Believe me.  There will be a very substantial penalty to be paid when they fire their people and move to another country, make the product, and think that they're going to sell it back over what will soon be a very, very strong border.  Going to be a lot different.  It’s going to be a lot different.  (Applause.) Already American industry will come roaring back.  And believe me if we -- not me, I’m a messenger -- if we didn't have this victory, we wouldn’t be even talking about it.  To achieve that goal, we’re going to massively reduce job-crushing regulations -- already started; you've seen that -- that send our jobs to those other countries.  We are going to lower taxes on American business so it’s cheaper and easier to produce product and beautiful things like airplanes right here in America.  (Applause.) We are going to enforce -- very strongly enforce our trade rules and stop foreign cheating.  Tremendous cheating.  Tremendous cheating.  We want products made by our workers, in our factories, stamped with those four magnificent words:  Made in the USA.  (Applause.) AUDIENCE:  U-S-A!  U-S-A!  U-S-A!THE PRESIDENT:  Since November, jobs have already begun to surge.  We’re seeing companies open up factories in America.  We’re seeing them keep jobs at home.  Ford, General Motors, Fiat-Chrysler -- just to name a very, very few.  So many more already.  They are keeping and bringing thousands of jobs back in country because the business climate, they know, has already changed.  In Arizona, Intel announced it will open a new plant that will create 10,000 American jobs.  They are spending billions of dollars.  (Applause.)   We will see more and more of that across the country as we continue to work on reducing regulations, cutting taxes -- including for the middle class, including for everyone, and including for business -- and creating a level playing field for our workers.  When there is a level playing field, and I’ve been saying this for a long time, American workers will always, always, always win.  But we don’t have a level playing field.  Very shortly, you will have a level playing field again.  (Applause.)  Because when American workers win, America as a country wins -- big league wins.  That’s my message here today.  America is going to start winning again -- winning like never, ever before.  We are not going to let our country be taken advantage of anymore in any way, shape or form.  We love America, and we are going to protect America.  We love our workers, and we are going to protect our workers.  We are going to fight for our jobs, we are going to fight for our families and we are going to fight to get more jobs and better-paying jobs for the loyal citizens of our country.  Believe me.  (Applause.)   You’ve heard me say it before, and I will say it again:  From now on, it’s going to be America first.  (Applause.)  Working together as a unit, there is nothing we cannot accomplish -- no task too large, no dream too great, no goal beyond our reach.  Just like you built this incredible airplane behind me -- both of them, when you think about it -- we are going to rebuild this country and ensure that every forgotten community has the bright future it deserves.  And by the way, those communities are forgotten no longer.  The election took care of that.  (Applause.)   And we will pass on to our children the freedom and prosperity that is their American birthright.  Our children will inherit from us a nation that is strong, that is proud and that is totally free.  And each of you will be part of creating that new American future.  I want to thank you, South Carolina.  I want to thank the great people of South Carolina.  God bless you, may God bless the United States of America, and God bless B"
2017-02-16;https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/02/16/remarks-president-trump-signing-hj-resolution-38;Remarks by President Trump at Signing of H.J. Resolution 38; PRESIDENT:  Okay.  We had an exciting news conference before.  And some people loved it.  I think nobody hated it, but it was -- I think it was very productive.  And thank you all for being there, that was very nice.  And thank you, all of the wonderful politicians, but -- right, Mitch, especially the miners that are with us, right?  So I just want to thank you.  Seriously.  (Applause.)  We appreciate it.  We appreciate it very much.And this is our second bill signing this week as we continue to work for the American people.  This is H.J. Resolution 38, and that will eliminate another terrible job-killing rule, saving many thousands of American jobs, especially in the mines, which I’ve been promising you.  The mines are a big deal.  I’ve had support from some of you folks right from the very beginning, and I won’t forget it.  I went to West Virginia and I -- we had 17,000, 18,000 people that couldn’t get into that big arena, right?  You were a few of them.  But that was some day and some night.  I want to thank Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, House Speaker Paul Ryan, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, House Natural Resources Committee Chairman Rob Bishop -- thank you, Rob -- and Representative Bill Johnson, who worked very hard on this bill.  And they really did, they worked very hard.  This was a tough one.I also want to thank the great members of Congress who have joined us today.  We have a lot of them.  In eliminating this rule, I am continuing to keep my promise to the American people to get rid of wasteful regulations that do nothing -- absolutely nothing -- but slow down the economy, hamstring companies, push jobs to other countries -- which is happening all over, although I must tell you, we’ve stopped it.  You’ve seen all the factories, all the plants that are moving back.  They’re going back to a lot of places.  So you know that, right, fellas?  They’re moving back fast.  Ford, General Motors, Fiat -- so many.  Very happy.Compliance costs for this rule would be over $50 million a year for the coal industry alone, and it’s unnecessary.  I want to also thank the incredible coal miners who are with us today.  I think we can maybe thank them the most, right, for -- political leaders.  (Applause.)  You folks have put up with a lot.  And you know, in other countries, they love their coal.  Over here, we haven’t treated it with the respect it deserves.  Even for defense, having that coal is a very important thing for us.  So I want to thank you all.This rule we’re eliminating it’s a major threat to your jobs, and we’re going to get rid of that threat immediately.  We’re going to fight for you like I promised I would in the campaign.  And you were very good to me, and I’m going to be even better to you, I promise you that.And we’re going to fight for, also, low-energy prices for all Americans.  There’s a spirit of optimism rising across the country.  It’s going to continue to grow as we sign more and more bills.  We’re going to make our nation more than competitive -- not just competitive, we’re going to be more than competitive.  And we’re going to win at many, many industries.  We’re already starting back with the automobile industry.  We had the airline industry in the other day.  They have rules and regulations that by the time they get through it, it’s -- nothing left, and they have to get rid of a lot of jobs.  We had a great meeting, actually.We had the unions in.  We had the workers in.  We had a lot of people in, and they were all very excited about what’s happening.  And I haven’t looked yet at the stock market, but it’s been going up at record clips.  We have a tremendous streak going on.  And that’s only because of the optimism.  They feel the optimism.  And that optimism is creating a lot of jobs.So it’s an honor to have everybody with us, and, in particular, the miners.  We appreciate everything you’ve done, fellas.  Thank you very much.  Would anybody like to say a few words?  How about one of the miners saying a few words?  I hear these guys all the time.  I hear Rand all the time.  (Laughter.)  Come on.  Who’d like to -- come on, Mike.MR. NELSON:  President Trump, we thank you very much for everything you’ve done for us.  Everything that you’re doing for our industry is very much needed.  I’ve been mining in this industry for 40 years, and this is a very exciting time for our industry.  Thank you very much.THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.SENATOR MANCHIN:  Tell him where you’re from, Mike.MR. NELSON:  I’m from Morgantown, West Virginia, but I work at the Marion County Coal Company.THE PRESIDENT:  How did I do in that area?MR. NELSON:  Oh, you did great.  (Laughter and applause.)THE PRESIDENT:  Good.  Good.  Say something.CONGRESSWOMAN CAPITO:  Well, President Trump --THE PRESIDENT:  You’re a -- you represent.CONGRESSWOMAN CAPITO:  Yes.  Representing West Virginia as the Senator, and Senator Manchin and I, and we have our congressional delegation here -- Congressman Jenkins, Congressman McKinley, and Congressman Mooney.  This is a lifeline to us, and these miners, they mine in West Virginia.  It’s a source of pride for us as a state that we’ve been able to power this country, and that we’ve had the opportunity to provide the energy to this country.  And thank you for being a partner with us and being a leader, President Trump, in this.  We believe in this, and we believe in your commitment to making sure American miners get back to work.  Thank you.THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  (Applause.) SENATOR PAUL:  This is a big day for Kentucky.  We want to thank President Trump for getting rid of this job-killing regulation.  It was scheduled to cost us thousands of more jobs.  Nobody seemed to care about Kentucky, but I can promise you, Eastern Kentucky voted about 75 percent for Donald J. Trump.  (Applause.) SENATOR MANCHIN:  Let me just say something very quickly.  There’s not a miner here that’s not an environmentalist.  So when people say that we don’t want to do the right thing -- there’s a balance between the environment and the economy, these miners would be the first ones to tell you.  They’re out in the woods, they’re hunting, they’re fishing, they’re doing everything possible.  All they want is the respect that -- basically they’ve given us the country we have because of the hard work of them and their fathers and grandfathers and all of their family has done.  So I’m so proud.  These are all West Virginians too.  Makes it even prouder for all of us.  So thank you.  God bless you.LEADER MCCONNELL:  Well, Mr. President, you know that the last eight years brought a depression -- a depression -- to Eastern Kentucky, and our folks are so excited to have a pro-coal President.  And we thank you so much for being on our side.  (Applause.)THE PRESIDENT:  Anybody else?  Come on.  Sure.  Absolutely.  You deserve it.LEADER MCCONNELL:  Thank you, Mr. President.THE PRESIDENT:  You deserve it.  Come on up.PARTICIPANT:  Well, Mr. President, this is an example of what you talked about so much during your campaign.  This is what is going to make America great again.  This is the legislative branch and you working together to keep the promise that you made to put coal miners back to work and to save the coal industry.  If we had not overturned this rule, we were looking at nearly 70,000 jobs across the country, and about 80 percent of our coal reserves being unavailable.  So thank you for your willingness to work with us to get this done.  It’s very, very important to the coal miners of this country and to our electricity grid.  Thank you, Mr. President.  (Applause.) PARTICIPANT:  As a 45-year miner, I’m very proud to be in this historic building, and I am very proud to be here with my President of the United States, who keeps his word.  And we thank you very much, sir.THE PRESIDENT:  It’s a great honor.  (Applause.)So I want to thank everybody.  And tell your friends back in West Virginia and Kentucky and all the other places where we worked -- Wyoming --SENATOR HEITKAMP:  North Dakota.REPRESENTATIVE JORDAN:  Ohio.THE PRESIDENT:  North Dakota.  Ohio.REPRESENTATIVE LAMBORN:  Colorado.THE PRESIDENT:  You’re right about that.  They have been fantastic.  Everybody’s been -- actually, everybody’s been great, and we appreciate it very much.  Special people.  Special workers.  We’re bringing it back, and we’re bringing it back fast.  We didn’t have to wait a long period of time.  It’s been very few days since I’ve been here, and I think this is long ahead of schedule, right?  Wouldn’t you say even --SENATOR MANCHIN:  Absolutely.THE PRESIDENT:  Even you might say -- (laughter) -- this is about four years faster than they thought would have happened.  So it’s my honor.  And, fellas, go back to work, all right?  I think we’ll take them into the Oval Office, right?  Let’s take them into the Oval Office.  Let’s have a little tour, okay?  They’ve probably been there many times before.  (Laughter.)  Come on.  Come with me.  Good.  Thank you, everybody.  Thank you, very much.AIDE:  Sign the bill here. THE PRESIDENT:  Oh.  (Laughter.) I could have gotten away with it.PARTICIPANT:  I
2017-02-16;https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/02/16/remarks-president-trump-press-conference;Remarks by President Trump in Press Conference ;"Thank you very much.  I just wanted to begin by mentioning that the nominee for Secretary of the Department of Labor will be Mr. Alex Acosta.  He has a law degree from Harvard Law School, was a great student.  Former clerk for Justice Samuel Alito.  And he has had a tremendous career.  He's a member, and has been a member, of the National Labor Relations Board, and has been through Senate confirmation three times, confirmed -- did very, very well.  And so Alex, I've wished him the best.  We just spoke.  And he's going to be -- I think he'll be a tremendous Secretary of Labor. And also, as you probably heard just a little while ago, Mick Mulvaney, former congressman, has just been approved -- weeks late, I have to say that.  Weeks, weeks late.  Office of Management and Budget.  And he will be, I think, a fantastic addition.  Paul Singer has just left.  As you know, Paul was very much involved with the anti-Trump, or, as they say, ""Never Trump.""  And Paul just left and he's given us his total support.  And it's all about unification.  We're unifying the party, and hopefully we're going to be able to unify the country.  It's very important to me.  I've been talking about that for a long time, but it's very, very important to me.  So I want to thank Paul Singer for being here and for coming up to the office.  He was a very strong opponent, and now he's a very strong ally.  And I appreciate that.I think I'll say a few words, and then we'll take some questions.  And I had this time -- we've been negotiating a lot of different transactions to save money on contracts that were terrible, including airplane contracts that were out of control and late and terrible.  Just absolutely catastrophic in terms of what was happening.  And we've done some really good work.  We're very proud of that.  And then right after that, you prepare yourselves and we'll do some questions -- unless you have no questions.  That's always a possibility.  I'm here today to update the American people on the incredible progress that has been made in the last four weeks since my inauguration.  We have made incredible progress.  I don’t think there's ever been a President elected who, in this short period of time, has done what we've done.  A new Rasmussen poll, in fact -- because the people get it; much of the media doesn’t get it.  They actually get it, but they don’t write it -- let's put it that way.  But a new Rasmussen poll just came out just a very short while ago, and it has our approval rating at 55 percent and going up.  The stock market has hit record numbers, as you know.  And there has been a tremendous surge of optimism in the business world, which is -- to me means something much different than it used to.  It used to mean, oh, that's good.  Now it means that's good for jobs.  Very different.  Plants and factories are already starting to move back into the United States and big league -- Ford, General Motors, so many of them.  I'm making this presentation directly to the American people with the media present, which is an honor to have you this morning, because many of our nation's reporters and folks will not tell you the truth and will not treat the wonderful people of our country with the respect that they deserve.  And I hope going forward we can be a little bit different, and maybe get along a little bit better, if that's possible.  Maybe it's not, and that's okay too. Unfortunately, much of the media in Washington, D.C., along with New York, Los Angeles, in particular, speaks not for the people but for the special interests and for those profiting off a very, very obviously broken system.  The press has become so dishonest that if we don’t talk about it, we are doing a tremendous disservice to the American people -- tremendous disservice.  We have to talk about it to find out what's going on, because the press honestly is out of control.  The level of dishonesty is out of control.I ran for President to represent the citizens of our country.  I am here to change the broken system so it serves their families and their communities well.  I am talking, and really talking, on this very entrenched power structure, and what we're doing is we're talking about the power structure, we're talking about its entrenchment.  As a result, the media is going through what they have to go through to oftentimes distort -- not all the time -- and some of the media is fantastic, I have to say; they're honest and fantastic.  But much of it is not -- the distortion.  And we'll talk about it, and you'll be able to ask me questions about it.But we're not going to let it happen, because I'm here again to take my message straight to the people.  As you know, our administration inherited many problems across government and across the economy.  To be honest, I inherited a mess -- it’s a mess -- at home and abroad.  A mess.  Jobs are pouring out of the country.  You see what’s going on with all of the companies leaving our country, going to Mexico and other places -- low-pay, low-wages.  Mass instability overseas, no matter where you look.  The Middle East, a disaster.  North Korea -- we’ll take care of it, folks.  We're going to take care of it all.  I just want to let you know I inherited a mess.  Beginning on day one, our administration went to work to tackle these challenges.  On foreign affairs, we've already begun enormously productive talks with many foreign leaders -- much of it you've covered -- to move forward toward stability, security, and peace in the most troubled regions of the world, which there are many.We've had great conversations with the United Kingdom -- and meetings -- Israel, Mexico, Japan, China, and Canada.  Really, really productive conversations.  I would say far more productive than you would understand.  We've even developed a new council with Canada to promote women’s business leaders and entrepreneurs.  It's very important to me, very important to my daughter Ivanka.  I have directed our defense community, headed by our great general, now Secretary Mattis -- he’s over there now, working very hard -- to submit a plan for the defeat of ISIS, a group that celebrates the murder and torture of innocent people in large sections of the world.  It used to be a small group, and now it’s in large sections of the world.  They've spread like cancer.  ISIS has spread like cancer.  Another mess I inherited.  And we have imposed new sanctions on the nation of Iran, who’s totally taken advantage of our previous administration.  And they're the world’s top sponsor of terrorism.  And we're not going to stop until that problem is properly solved.  And it’s not properly solved now.  It’s one of the worst agreements I’ve ever seen drawn by anybody.  I’ve ordered plans to begin for the massive rebuilding of the United States military.  I’ve had great support from the Senate.  I’ve had great support from Congress generally.  We've pursued this rebuilding in the hopes that we will never have to use this military.  And I will tell you that is my -- I would be so happy if we never had to use it.  But our country will never have had a military like the military we're about to build and rebuild.  We have the greatest people on Earth in our military, but they don't have the right equipment.  And their equipment is old.  I used it, I talked about it at every stop.  Depleted -- it’s depleted.  It won’t be depleted for long.  And I think one of the reasons I’m standing here instead of other people is that, frankly, I talked about we have to have a strong military.  We have to have strong law enforcement also.  So we do not go abroad in the search of war.  We really are searching for peace, but it’s peace through strength.  At home, we have begun the monumental task of returning the government back to the people on a scale not seen in many, many years.  In each of these actions, I’m keeping my promises to the American people.  These are campaign promises.  Some people are so surprised that we're having strong borders.  Well, that's what I’ve been talking about for a year and a half -- strong borders.  They're so surprised -- ""oh, you're having strong borders.""  Well, that's what I’ve been talking about to the press and to everybody else.  One promise after another after years of politicians lying to you to get elected.  They lie to the American people in order to get elected.  Some of the things I’m doing probably aren’t popular, but they're necessary for security and for other reasons.  And then coming to Washington and pursuing their own interests, which is more important to many politicians.I’m here following through on what I pledged to do.  That's all I’m doing.  I put it out before the American people.  Got 306 Electoral College votes.  I wasn’t supposed to get 222.  They said there’s no way to get 222; 230 is impossible.  Two hundred and seventy, which you need, that was laughable.  We got 306 because people came out and voted like they've never seen before.  So that's the way it goes.  I guess it was the biggest Electoral College win since Ronald Reagan.  In other words, the media is trying to attack our administration because they know we are following through on pledges that we made, and they're not happy about it for whatever reason.  But a lot of people are happy about it.  In fact, I’ll be in Melbourne, Florida, five o’clock on Saturday, and I heard -- just heard that the crowds are massive that want to be there.  I turn on the TV, open the newspapers, and I see stories of chaos.  Chaos!  Yet, it is the exact opposite.  This administration is running like a fine-tuned machine, despite the fact that I can’t get my Cabinet approved, and they’re outstanding people.  Like Senator Dan Coates whose there -- one of the most respected men of the Senate -- he can’t get approved.  How do you not approve him?  He’s been a colleague, highly respected -- brilliant guy, great guy, everybody knows it -- but waiting for approval.So we have a wonderful group of people that’s working very hard, that’s being very much misrepresented about, and we can’t let that happen.  So if the Democrats, who have -- all you have to do is look at where they are right now -- the only thing they can do is delay, because they’ve screwed things up royally, believe me. Let me list to you some of the things that we’ve done in just a short period of time.  I just got here.  I got here with no Cabinet.  Again, each of these actions is a promise I made to the American people.  So we’ll go over just some of them, and we have a lot happening next week and in the weeks coming.  We’ve withdrawn from the job-killing disaster known as Trans-Pacific Partnership.  We’re going to make trade deals, but we’re going to have one-on-one deals -- bilateral.  We’re going to have one-on-one deals.We’ve directed the elimination of regulations that undermine manufacturing, and called for expedited approval of the permits needed for America and American infrastructure, and that means plants, equipment, roads, bridges, factories.  People take 10, 15, 20 years to get disapproved for a factory.  They go in for a permit -- it’s many, many years.  And then at the end of the process -- they spend tens of millions of dollars on nonsense -- and at the end of the process, they get rejected.  Now, they may be rejected with me, but it’s going to be a quick rejection.  It's not going to take years.  But mostly, it’s going to be an acceptance.  We want plants built, and we want factories built, and we want the jobs.  We don’t want the jobs going to other countries.  We’ve imposed a hiring freeze on nonessential federal workers.  We’ve imposed a temporary moratorium on new federal regulations.  We’ve issued a game-changing new rule that says for each one new regulation, two old regulations must be eliminated.  Makes sense.  Nobody has ever seen regulations like we have.  If you go to other countries and you look at industries they have, and you say, let me see your regulations, and they're a fraction, just a tiny fraction of what we have.  And I want regulations because I want safety, I want all environmental situations to be taken properly care of.  It’s very important to me.  But you don’t need four or five or six regulations to take care of the same thing.We’ve stood up for the men and women of law enforcement, directing federal agencies to ensure they are protected from crimes of violence.  We’ve directed the creation of a task force for reducing violent crime in America, including the horrendous situation -- take a look at Chicago and others -- taking place right now in our inner cities.  Horrible.  We’ve ordered the Department of Homeland Security and Justice to coordinate on a plan to destroy criminal cartels coming into the United States with drugs.  We’re becoming a drug-infested nation.  Drugs are becoming cheaper than candy bars, and we’re not going to let it happen any longer.  We’ve undertaken the most substantial border security measures in a generation to keep our nation and our tax dollars safe, and are now in the process of beginning to build a promised wall on the southern border.  Met with General, now Secretary, Kelly yesterday and we’re starting that process.  And the wall is going to be a great wall, and it’s going to be a wall negotiated by me.  The price is going to come down, just like it has on everything else I’ve negotiated for the government.  And we’re going to have a wall that works.  We’re not going to have a wall like they have now, which is either nonexistent or a joke.  We’ve ordered a crackdown on sanctuary cities that refuse to comply with federal law and that harbor criminal aliens, and we’ve ordered an end to the policy of catch and release on the border.  No more release, no matter who you are -- release.  We’ve begun a nationwide effort to remove criminal aliens, gang members, drug dealers, and others who pose a threat to public safety.  We are saving American lives every single day.  The court system has not made it easy for us.  And we've even created a new office in Homeland Security dedicated to the forgotten American victims of illegal immigrant violence, of which there are many.We’ve taken decisive action to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of our country.  Though parts of our necessary and constitutional actions were blocked by a judge’s, in my opinion, incorrect and unsafe ruling, our administration is working night and day to keep you safe -- including reporters safe -- and is vigorously defending this lawful order.  I will not back down from defending our country.  I got elected on defense of our country.  And I keep my campaign promises.  And our citizens will be very happy when they see the result.  They already are.  I can tell you that.Extreme vetting will be put in place, and it already is in place in many places.  In fact, we had to go quicker than we thought because of the bad decision we received from a circuit that has been overturned at a record number.  I've heard 80 percent -- I find that hard to believe; that's just a number I heard -- that they're overturned 80 percent of the time.  I think that circuit is in chaos and that circuit is, frankly, in turmoil.  But we are appealing that and we are going further.  We're issuing a new executive action next week that will comprehensively protect our country, so we'll be going along the one path and hopefully winning that.  At the same time, we will be issuing a new and very comprehensive order to protect our people, and that will be done some time next week, toward the beginning or middle at the latest part.We've also taken steps to begin construction of the Keystone Pipeline and Dakota Access Pipelines -- thousands and thousands of jobs -- and put new ""Buy American"" measures in place to require American steel for American pipelines.  In other words, they build a pipeline in this country and we use the powers of government to make that pipeline happen.  We want them to use American steel.  And they're willing to do that, but nobody ever asked before I came along.  Even this order was drawn and they didn't say that.  And I'm reading the order, I'm saying, why aren't we using American steel?  And they said, that's a good idea.  We put it in.To drain the swamp of corruption in Washington, D.C. I've started by imposing a five-year lobbying ban on White House officials and a lifetime ban on lobbying for a foreign government.  We've begun preparing to repeal and replace Obamacare.  Obamacare is a disaster, folks.  It's a disaster.  You can say, oh, Obamacare -- I mean, they fill up our alleys with people that you wonder how they get there, but they're not the Republican people that our representatives are representing.  So we've begun preparing to repeal and replace Obamacare and are deep in the midst of negotiations on a very historic tax reform to bring our jobs back.  We're bringing our jobs back to this country big league.  It's already happening, but big league.I've also worked to install a Cabinet over the delays and obstruction of Senate Democrats.  You've seen what they've done over the last long number of years.  That will be one of the great Cabinets ever assembled in American history.  You look at Rex Tillerson -- he's out there negotiating right now.  General Mattis I mentioned before, General Kelly.  We have great, great people.  Mick is with us now.  We have great people.Among their responsibilities will be ending the bleeding of jobs from our country and negotiating fair trade deals for our citizens.  Now, look, fair trade -- not free -- fair.  If a country is taking advantage of us, we're not going to let that happen anymore.  Every country takes advantage of us, almost.  I may be able to find a couple that don't.  But for the most part, that would be a very tough job for me to do.  Jobs have already started to surge.  Since my election, Ford announced it will abandon its plans to build a new factory in Mexico and will instead invest $700 million in Michigan, creating many, many jobs.  Fiat-Chrysler announced it will invest $1 billion in Ohio and Michigan, creating 2,000 new American jobs.  They were with me a week ago.  You know -- you were here.  General Motors, likewise, committed to invest billions of dollars in its American manufacturing operation, keeping many jobs here that were going to leave.  And if I didn't get elected, believe me, they would have left.  And these jobs and these things that I'm announcing would never have come here.  Intel just announced that it will move ahead with a new plant in Arizona that probably was never going to move ahead with.  And that will result in at least 10,000 American jobs.  Walmart announced it will create 10,000 jobs in the United States just this year because of our various plans and initiatives.  There will be many, many more.  Many more.  These are a few that we're naming.Other countries have been taking advantage of us for decades -- decades and decades and decades, folks.  And we’re not going to let that happen anymore.  Not going to let it happen.And one more thing.  I have kept my promise to the American people by nominating a justice of the United States Supreme Court, Judge Neil Gorsuch, who is from my list of 20, and who will be a true defender of our laws and our Constitution -- highly respected, should get the votes from the Democrats -- you may not see that, but he’ll get there one way or the other.  But he should get there the old-fashioned way, and he should get those votes.This last month has represented an unprecedented degree of action on behalf of the great citizens of our country.  Again, I say it -- there has never been a presidency that’s done so much in such a short period of time.  And we haven’t even started the big work that starts early next week.  Some very big things are going to be announced next week.  So we’re just getting started.  We will be giving a speech, as I said, in Melbourne, Florida, at 5:00 p.m.  I hope to see you there.  And with that, I’d just say, God bless America, and let’s take some questions. Mara.  Mara, go ahead.  You were cut off pretty violently at our last news conference.Q    Did you fire Mike Flynn?THE PRESIDENT:  Mike Flynn is a fine person, and I asked for his resignation.  He respectfully gave it.  He is a man who -- there was a certain amount of information given to Vice President Pence, who is with us today.  And I was not happy with the way that information was given.  He didn’t have to do that, because what he did wasn’t wrong, what he did in terms of the information he saw.  What was wrong was the way that other people, including yourselves in this room, were given that information, because that was classified information that was given illegally.  That’s the real problem.  And you can talk all you want about Russia, which was all a fake news, fabricated deal to try and make up for the loss of the Democrats, and the press plays right into it.  In fact, I saw a couple of the people that were supposedly involved with all of this -- they know nothing about it.  They weren’t in Russia, they never made a phone call to Russia, they never received a phone call.  It’s all fake news.  It’s all fake news.The nice thing is I see it starting to turn, where people are now looking at the illegal, Mara -- and I think it’s very important -- the illegal giving out classified information.  And let me just tell you, it was given out, like, so much.  I’ll give you an example.  I called, as you know, Mexico.  It was a very confidential, classified call, but I called Mexico.  And in calling Mexico, I figured, oh, well, that’s -- I spoke to the President of Mexico, had a good call.  All of a sudden it’s out for the world to see.  It’s supposed to be secret.  It’s supposed to be either confidential or classified in that case.  Same thing with Australia.  All of a sudden people are finding out exactly what took place.  The same thing happened with respect to General Flynn.  Everybody saw this, and I’m saying -- the first thing I thought of when I heard about it is, how does the press get this information that’s classified?  How do they do it?  You know why?  Because it’s an illegal process, and the press should be ashamed of themselves.  But, more importantly, the people that gave out the information to the press should be ashamed of themselves.  Really ashamed.Yes, go ahead.Q    Why did you keep your Vice President in the dark for almost two weeks? THE PRESIDENT:  Because when I looked at the information, I said, I don’t think he did anything wrong.  If anything, he did something right.  He was coming into office, he looked at the information.  He said, huh, that’s fine, that’s what they’re supposed to do.  They’re supposed to be -- and he didn’t just call Russia.  He called and spoke to, both ways -- I think there were 30-some-odd countries.  He’s doing the job.You know, he was just doing his job.  The thing is he didn’t tell our Vice President properly, and then he said he didn’t remember.  So either way, it wasn’t very satisfactory to me.  And I have somebody that I think will be outstanding for the position, and that also helps, I think, in the making of my decision.But he didn’t tell the Vice President of the United States the facts, and then he didn’t remember.  And that just wasn’t acceptable to me.  Yes.Q    President Trump, since you brought up Russia, I'm looking for some clarification here.  During the campaign, did anyone from your team communicate with members of the Russian government or Russian intelligence?  And if so, what was the nature of those conversations?  THE PRESIDENT:  Well, the failing New York Times wrote a big, long front-page story yesterday.  And it was very much discredited, as you know.  It was -- it’s a joke.  And the people mentioned in the story -- I notice they were on television today saying they never even spoke to Russia.  They weren’t even a part, really -- I mean, they were such a minor part -- I hadn’t spoken to them.  I think the one person, I don’t think I’ve ever spoken to him.  I don’t think I’ve ever met him.  And he actually said he was a very low-level member of, I think, a committee for a short period of time.  I don’t think I ever met him.  Now, it’s possible that I walked into a room and he was sitting there, but I don’t think I ever met him.  I didn’t talk to him, ever.  And he thought it was a joke.The other person said he never spoke to Russia, never received a call.  Look at his phone records, et cetera, et cetera.  And the other person, people knew that he’d represented various countries, but I don't think he represented Russia -- but knew that he represented various countries.  That's what he does.  I mean, people know that.  That's Mr. Manafort, who's, by the way -- who's, by the way, a respected man.  He’s a respected man.  But I think he represented the Ukraine, or Ukraine government, or somebody.  But everybody -- people knew that.  Everybody knew that.  So these people -- and he said that he has absolutely nothing to do and never has with Russia.  And he said that very forcefully.  I saw his statement.  He said it very forcefully.  Most of the papers don't print it because that's not good for their stories.  So the three people that they talked about all totally deny it.  And I can tell you, speaking for myself, I own nothing in Russia.  I have no loans in Russia.  I don't have any deals in Russia.  President Putin called me up very nicely to congratulate me on the win of the election.  He then called me up extremely nicely to congratulate me on the inauguration, which was terrific.  But so did many other leaders -- almost all other leaders from almost all other countries.  So that's the extent.Russia is fake news.  Russia -- this is fake news put out by the media.  The real news is the fact that people, probably from the Obama administration because they're there -- because we have our new people going in place right now.  As you know, Mike Pompeo is now taking control of the CIA.  James Comey at FBI.  Dan Coats is waiting to be approved.  I mean, he is a senator, and a highly respected one.  And he’s still waiting to be approved.  But our new people are going in.  And just while you're at, because you mentioned this, Wall Street Journal did a story today that was almost as disgraceful as the failing New Times’s story yesterday.  And it talked about -- you saw it, front page.  So, Director of National Intelligence just put out -- acting -- a statement:  “Any suggestion that the United States intelligence community” -- this was just given to us -- “is withholding information and not providing the best possible intelligence to the President and his national security team is not true.”So they took this front-page story out of The Wall Street Journal -- top -- and they just wrote the story is not true.  And I’ll tell you something, I’ll be honest -- because I sort of enjoy this back and forth, and I guess I have all my life, but I’ve never seen more dishonest media than, frankly, the political media.  I thought the financial media was much better, much more honest.  But I will say that I never get phone calls from the media.  How do they write a story like that in The Wall Street Journal without asking me?  Or how do they write a story in The New York Times, put it on front page?  That was like that story they wrote about the women and me -- front page.  Big massive story.  And it was nasty. And then they called.  They said, ""We never said that.  We like Mr. Trump.""  They called up my office -- we like Mr. Trump; we never said that.  And it was totally -- they totally misrepresented those very wonderful women, I have to tell you -- totally misrepresented.  I said, give us a retraction.  They never gave us a retraction.  And, frankly, I then went on to other things.Go ahead.  Q    Mr. President -- THE PRESIDENT:  You okay?Q    I am.  Just wanted to get untangled.  Very simply, you said today that you had the biggest electoral margins since Ronald Reagan with 304 or 306 electoral votes.  In fact, President Obama got 365 in 2008.THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I’m talking about Republican.  Yes. Q    President Obama, 332.  George H.W. Bush, 426 when he won as President.  So why should Americans trust --  THE PRESIDENT:  Well, no, I was told -- I was given that information.  I don't know.  I was just given.  We had a very, very big margin. Q    I guess my question is, why should Americans trust you when you have accused the information they receive of being fake when you're providing information that's fake?THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I don't know.  I was given that information.  I was given -- actually, I’ve seen that information around.  But it was a very substantial victory.  Do you agree with that? Q    You're the President.  THE PRESIDENT:  Okay, thank you.  That's a good answer.  Yes.Q    Mr. President, thank you so much.  Can you tell us in determining that Lieutenant General Flynn -- there was no wrongdoing in your mind, what evidence was weighed?  Did you have the transcripts of these telephone intercepts with Russian officials, particularly Ambassador Kislyak, who he was communicating with?  What evidence did you weigh to determine there was no wrong doing?  And further than that, sir, you've said on a couple of occasions this morning that you were going to aggressively pursue the sources of these leaks.THE PRESIDENT:  We are.Q    Can we ask what you're doing to do?  And also, we've heard about a review of the intelligence community headed by Stephen Feinberg.  What can you tell us about that?THE PRESIDENT:  Well, first of all, about that, we now have Dan Coats, hopefully soon Mike Pompeo and James Comey, and they're in position.  So I hope that we’ll be able to straighten that out without using anybody else.  The gentleman you mentioned is a very talented man, very successful man.  And he has offered his services, and it’s something we may take advantage of.  But I don't think we’ll need that at all because of the fact that I think that we're going to be able to straighten it out very easily on its own.As far as the general is concerned, when I first heard about it, I said, huh, that doesn't sound wrong.  My counsel came -- Don McGahn, White House Counsel -- and he told me, and I asked him, and he can speak very well for himself.  He said he doesn't think anything is wrong.  He really didn't think -- it was really what happened after that, but he didn't think anything was done wrong.  I didn't either, because I waited a period of time and I started to think about it.  I said, well, I don't see -- to me, he was doing the job.  The information was provided by -- who I don't know -- Sally Yates -- and I was a little surprised because I said, doesn't sound like he did anything wrong there.  But he did something wrong with respect to the Vice President, and I thought that was not acceptable.  As far as the actual making the call -- in fact, I've watched various programs and I've read various articles where he was just doing his job.  That was very normal.  At first, everybody got excited because they thought he did something wrong.  After they thought about it, it turned out he was just doing his job.So -- and I do -- and, by the way, with all of that being said, I do think he's a fine man.  Yes, Jon.Q    On the leaks, sir -- THE PRESIDENT:  Go ahead, finish off, then I'll get you, Jon.Q    Sorry, what will you do on the leaks?  You have said twice today -- THE PRESIDENT:  Yes, we're looking at it very, very seriously.  I've gone to all of the folks in charge of the various agencies, and we're -- I've actually called the Justice Department to look into the leaks.  Those are criminal leaks.  They're put out by people either in agencies.  I think you'll see it stopping because now we have our people in.  You know, again, we don't have our people in because we can't get them approved by the Senate.  We just had Jeff Sessions approved in Justice, as an example.  So we are looking into that very seriously.  It's a criminal act.  You know what I say -- when I was called out on Mexico, I was shocked.  Because all this equipment, all this incredible phone equipment.  When I was called out on Mexico, I was -- honestly, I was really, really surprised.  But I said, you know, it doesn't make sense, that won't happen.  But that wasn't that important to call, it was fine.  I could show it to the world and he could show it to the world -- the President who is a very fine man, by the way.  Same thing with Australia.  I said, that's terrible that it was leaked but it wasn't that important.  But then I said, what happens when I'm dealing with the problem of North Korea?  What happens when I'm dealing with the problems in the Middle East?  Are you folks going to be reporting all of that very, very confidential information -- very important, very -- I mean, at the highest level, are you going to be reporting about that too?So I don't want classified information getting out to the public.  And in a way, that was almost a test.  So I'm dealing with Mexico.  I'm dealing with Argentina.  We were dealing on this case with Mike Flynn.  All this information gets put into the Washington Post and gets put into the New York Times.  And I'm saying, what's going to happen when I'm dealing on the Middle East?  What's going to happen when I'm dealing with really, really important subjects like North Korea?  We've got to stop it.  That's why it's a criminal penalty.Yes, Jon.Q    Thank you, Mr. President.  I just want to get you to clarify just a very important point.  Can you say definitively that nobody on your campaign had any contacts with the Russians during the campaign?  And, on the leaks, is it fake news or are these real leaks?THE PRESIDENT:  Well, the leaks are real.  You're the one that wrote about them and reported them.  I mean, the leaks are real.  You know what they said -- you saw it.  And the leaks are absolutely real.  The news is fake because so much of the news is fake.  So one thing that I felt it was very important to do -- and I hope we can correct it, because there is nobody I have more respect for -- well, maybe a little bit -- than reporters, than good reporters.  It's very important to me, and especially in this position.  It's very important.  I don't mind bad stories.  I can handle a bad story better than anybody as long as it's true.  And over a course of time, I'll make mistakes and you'll write badly and I'm okay with that.  But I'm not okay when it is fake.  I mean, I watch CNN -- it's so much anger and hatred and just the hatred.  I don't watch it anymore because it's very good -- he's saying no.  It's okay, Jim.  It's okay, Jim.  You’ll have your chance.  But I watch others too.  You’re not the only one, so don’t feel badly.But I think it should be straight.  I think it should be -- I think it would be, frankly, more interesting.  I know how good everybody’s ratings are right now, but I think that actually would be -- I think that it would actually be better.  People -- I mean, you have a lower approval rate than Congress.  I think that’s right.  I don’t know, Peter, is that one right?  Because you know, I think they have lower -- I heard, lower than Congress.  But honestly, the public would appreciate it.  I’d appreciate it.  Again, I don’t mind bad stories when it’s true.  But we have an administration where the Democrats are making it very difficult.  I think we’re setting a record, or close to a record in the time of approval of a Cabinet.  I mean, the numbers are crazy.  When I’m looking -- some of them had them approved immediately.  I’m going forever, and I still have a lot of people that we’re waiting for.And that’s all they’re doing, is delaying.  And you look at Schumer and the mess that he’s got over there, and they have nothing going.  The only thing they can do is delay.  And you know, I think they’d be better served by approving and making sure that they’re happy and everybody is good.  And sometimes, I mean -- I know President Obama lost three or four, and you lose them on the way.  And that’s okay.  That’s fine.But I think they would be much better served, Jon, if they just went through the process quickly.  This is pure delay tactics.  And they say it, and everybody understands it.Yeah, go ahead, Jim.Q    The first part of my question on contacts.  Do you definitively say that nobody -- THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I had nothing to do with it.  I have nothing to do with Russia.  I told you, I have no deals there.  I have no anything.Now, when WikiLeaks, which I had nothing to do with, comes out and happens to give -- they’re not giving classified information.  They’re giving stuff -- what was said at an office about Hillary cheating on the debates -- which, by the way, nobody mentions.  Nobody mentions that Hillary received the questions to the debates. Can you imagine -- seriously, can you imagine if I received the questions?  It would be the electric chair, okay?  “He should be put in the electric chair.”  You would even call for the reinstitution of the death penalty, okay?  Maybe not you, Jon.Yes, we’ll do you next, Jim.  I’ll do you next.  Yes?Q    Thank you, Mr. President.  I just want to clarify one other thing.THE PRESIDENT:  Sure.Q    Did you direct Mike Flynn to discuss the sanctions with the Russian ambassador?THE PRESIDENT:  No, I didn’t.  No, I didn’t.  Q    (Inaudible.)  (Off mic.)THE PRESIDENT:  No, I didn’t.  Q    Did you fire him because (inaudible) -- THE PRESIDENT:  Excuse me -- no, I fired him because of what he said to Mike Pence, very simple.  Mike was doing his job.  He was calling countries and his counterparts.  So it certainly would have been okay with me if he did it.  I would have directed him to do it if I thought he wasn’t doing it.  I didn’t direct him but I would have directed him because that’s his job.And it came out that way -- and, in all fairness, I watched Dr. Charles Krauthammer the other night say he was doing his job.  And I agreed with him.  And since then I’ve watched many other people say that.No, I didn’t direct him, but I would have directed him if he didn’t do it, okay?  Jim.Q    Mr. President, thank you very much.  And just for the record, we don’t hate you, I don’t hate you.  If you could pass that along.  THE PRESIDENT:  Okay.  Well, ask Jeff Zucker how he got his job, okay?Q    If I may follow up on some of the questions that have taken place so far, sir.  THE PRESIDENT:  Well, not too many.  We do have other people.  You do have other people, and your ratings aren’t as good as some of the other people that are waiting.Q    They're pretty good right now, actually.THE PRESIDENT:  Okay.  Go ahead, Jim.Q    If I may ask, sir, you said earlier that WikiLeaks was revealing information about the Hillary Clinton campaign during the election cycle.  You welcomed that at one point.THE PRESIDENT:  I was okay with it.Q    You said you loved WikiLeaks.  At another campaign press conference you called on the Russians to find the missing 30,000 emails.  I’m wondering, sir, if you --THE PRESIDENT:  Well, she was actually missing 33,000, and then that got extended with a whole pile after that, but that’s okay.Q    Maybe my numbers are off a little bit too.THE PRESIDENT:  No, no, but I did say 30,000, but it was actually higher than that.Q    If I may ask you, sir, it sounds as though you do not have much credibility here when it comes to leaking if that is something that you encouraged in the campaign.THE PRESIDENT:  Okay, fair question.  Ready?Q    So if I may ask you that -- if I may ask a follow-up --THE PRESIDENT:  No, no, but are you -- let me do one at a time.  Do you mind?Q    Yes, sir.THE PRESIDENT:  All right.  So in one case you’re talking about highly classified information.  In the other case you’re talking about John Podesta saying bad things about the boss.  I will say this:  If John Podesta said that about me and he was working for me, I would have fired him so fast your head would have spun.  He said terrible things about her.  But it wasn’t classified information.  But in one case you’re talking about classified.  Regardless, if you look at the RNC, we had a very strong -- at my suggestion -- and I give Reince great credit for this -- at my suggestion, because I know something about this world, I said I want a very strong defensive mechanism.  I don’t want to be hacked.  And we did that, and you have seen that they tried to hack us and they failed.The DNC did not do that.  And if they did it, they could not have been hacked.  But they were hacked, and terrible things came.  And the only thing that I do think is unfair is some of the things were so -- they were -- when I heard some of those things, I said -- I picked up the papers the next morning, I said, oh, this is going to front page.  It wasn’t even in the papers.Again, if I had that happen to me, it would be the biggest story in the history of publishing or the head of newspapers.  I would have been the headline in every newspaper.  I mean, think of it.  They gave her the questions for the debate, and she should have reported herself.  Why didn’t Hillary Clinton announce that, ""I’m sorry, but I have been given the questions to a debate or a town hall, and I feel that it’s inappropriate, and I want to turn in CNN for not doing a good job""?Q    And if I may follow up on that, just something that Jonathan Karl was asking you about -- you said that the leaks are real, but the news is fake.  I guess I don't understand.  It seems that there is a disconnect there.  If the information coming from those leaks is real, then how can the stories be fake?THE PRESIDENT:  Well, the reporting is fake.  Look, look -- Q    And if I may ask -- I just want to ask one other question.  THE PRESIDENT:  Jim, you know what it is?  Here’s the thing.  The public isn’t -- they read newspapers, they see television, they watch.  They don't know if it’s true or false because they're not involved.  I’m involved.  I’ve been involved with this stuff all my life.  But I’m involved.  So I know when you're telling the truth or when you're not.  I just see many, many untruthful things.  And I tell you what else I see.  I see tone.  You know the word “tone.”  The tone is such hatred.  I’m really not a bad person, by the way.  No, but the tone is such -- I do get good ratings, you have to admit that.  The tone is such hatred.  I watched this morning a couple of the networks, and I have to say “Fox & Friends” in the morning, they're very honorable people.  They're very -- not because they're good, because they hit me also when I do something wrong.  But they have the most honest morning show.  That's all I can say.  It’s the most honest.  But the tone, Jim.  If you look -- the hatred.  I mean, sometimes -- sometimes somebody gets -- Q    (Off mic.)THE PRESIDENT:  Well, you look at your show that goes on at 10 o’clock in the evening.  You just take a look at that show.  That is a constant hit.  The panel is almost always exclusive anti-Trump.  The good news is he doesn't have good ratings.  But the panel is almost exclusive anti-Trump.  And the hatred and venom coming from his mouth, the hatred coming from other people on your network.Now, I will say this.  I watch it.  I see it.  I’m amazed by it.  And I just think you’d be a lot better off -- I honestly do.  The public gets it, you know.  Look, when I go to rallies, they turn around, they start screaming at CNN.  They want to throw their placards at CNN.  I think you would do much better by being different.  But you just take a look.  Take a look at some of your shows in the morning and the evening.  If a guest comes out and says something positive about me, it’s brutal.  Now, they’ll take this news conference.  I’m actually having a very good time, okay?  But they’ll take this news conference -- don't forget that's the way I won.  Remember, I used to give you a news conference every time I made a speech, which was like every day. Q    (Off mic.)THE PRESIDENT:  No, that's how I won.  I won with news conferences and probably speeches.  I certainly didn't win by people listening to you people, that's for sure. But I am having a good time.  Tomorrow they will say, Donald Trump rants and raves at the press.  I’m not ranting and raving.  I’m just telling you, you're dishonest people.  But -- but I’m not ranting and raving.  I love this.  I’m having a good time doing it.  But tomorrow the headlines are going to be:  Donald Trump Rants and Raves.  I’m not ranting and raving. Q    If I may just -- THE PRESIDENT:  Go ahead.Q    One more follow-up because -- THE PRESIDENT:  Should I let him have a little bit more?  What do you think, Peter?  Q    Just because of this -- THE PRESIDENT:  Peter, should I have let him have a little bit more?  Sit down.  Sit down.  Q    Just because of the attack -- THE PRESIDENT:  We’ll get it.  Q    Just because of the attack of fake news and attacking our network, I just want to ask you, sir -- THE PRESIDENT:  I’m changing it from fake news, though.Q    Doesn't that undermine -- THE PRESIDENT:  Very fake news now.  (Laughter.) Q    But aren’t you -- THE PRESIDENT:  Yes, go ahead.  Q    Real news, Mr. President.  Real news. THE PRESIDENT:  And you're not related to our new -- Q    I am not related, sir, no.  (Laughter.)  I do like the sound of Secretary Acosta, I must say.THE PRESIDENT:  I looked -- you know, I looked at that name.  I said, wait a minute, is there any relation there?  Alex Acosta. Q    I’m sure you checked that out, sir.THE PRESIDENT:  No, I checked it.  I said -- they said, no, sir.  I said, do me a favor, go back and check the family tree.  Q    But aren’t you concerned, sir, that you are undermining the people's faith in the First Amendment freedom of the press, the press in this country when you call stories you don't like “fake news”?  Why not just say it’s a story I don't like? THE PRESIDENT:  I do that.Q    When you call it fake news, you're undermining confidence -- THE PRESIDENT:  No, I do that.  No, no, I do that.Q    -- in our news media.THE PRESIDENT:  Here’s the thing.  Q    Isn’t that important?THE PRESIDENT:  Okay, I understand -- and you're right about that except this.  See, I know when I should get good and when I should get bad.  And sometimes I’ll say, wow, that's going to be a great story, and I’ll get killed.  I know what’s good and bad.  I’d be a pretty good reporter -- not as good as you.  But I know what’s good.  I know what’s bad.  And when they change it and make it really bad -- something that should be positive.  Sometimes something that should be very positive, they’ll make okay.  They’ll even make it negative.  So I understand it because I’m there.  I know what was said.  I know who is saying it.  I’m there.  So it’s very important to me.  Look, I want to see an honest press.  When I started off today by saying that it’s so important to the public to get an honest press.  The press -- the public doesn't believe you people anymore.  Now, maybe I had something to do with that, I don't know.  But they don't believe you.  If you were straight and really told it like it is, as Howard Cosell used to say, right?  Of course, he had some questions also.  But if you were straight, I would be your biggest booster, I would be your biggest fan in the world -- including bad stories about me.  But if you go -- as an example, you're CNN -- I mean, it’s story after story after story is bad.  I won.  I won.  And the other thing:  Chaos.  There’s zero chaos.  We are running -- this is a fine-tuned machine.  And Reince happens to be doing a good job.  But half of his job is putting out lies by the press.  I said to him yesterday, this whole Russia scam that you guys are building so that you don't talk about the real subject, which is illegal leaks.  But I watched him yesterday working so hard to try and get that story proper.  And I’m saying, here’s my Chief of Staff, a really good guy, did a phenomenal job at RNC.  I mean, we won the election, right?  We won the presidency.  We got some senators.  We got some -- all over the country, you take a look, he’s done a great job. And I said to myself, you know -- and I said to somebody that was in the room -- I said, you take a look at Reince, he’s working so hard just putting out fires that are fake fires.  They're fake.  They're not true.  And isn't that a shame, because he'd rather be working on health care.  He'd rather be working on tax reform, Jim.  I mean that.  I would be your biggest fan in the world if you treated me right.  I sort of understand there's a certain bias, maybe by Jeff or somebody -- for whatever reason.  And I understand that.  But you've got to be at least a little bit fair.  And that's why the public sees it -- they see it.  They see it's not fair.  You take a look at some of your shows and you see the bias and the hatred.  And the public is smart.  They understand it.  Okay, yeah, go ahead.  Q    We have no doubt that your latest story is (inaudible).  But for those who believe that there is something to it, is there anything that you have learned over these last few weeks that you might be able to reveal that might ease their concerns that this isn't fake news?  And secondly -- THE PRESIDENT:  I think they don't believe it.  I don't think the public would.  That's why the Rasmussen poll just has me through the roof.  I don't think they believe it.  Well, I guess one of the reasons I'm here today is to tell you the whole Russian thing -- that's a ruse.  That's a ruse.  And, by the way, it would be great if we could get along with Russia, just so you understand that.  Now, tomorrow you'll say, Donald Trump wants to get along with Russia, this is terrible.  It's not terrible -- it's good.We had Hillary Clinton try and do a reset.  We had Hillary Clinton give Russia 20 percent of the uranium in our country.  You know what uranium is, right?  It's this thing called nuclear weapons and other things.  Like, lots of things are done with uranium, including some bad things.  Nobody talks about that.  I didn't do anything for Russia.  I've done nothing for Russia.  Hillary Clinton gave them 20 percent of our uranium.  Hillary Clinton did a reset, remember, with the stupid plastic button that made us all look like a bunch of jerks?  Here, take a look.  He looked at her like, what the hell is she doing with that cheap plastic button?  Hillary Clinton -- that was a reset.  Remember?  It said ""reset."" Now, if I do that, oh, I'm a bad guy.  If we could get along with Russia, that's a positive thing.  We have a very talented man, Rex Tillerson, who is going to be meeting with them shortly.  And I told him, I said, I know politically it's probably not good for me.  Hey, the greatest thing I could do is shoot that ship that's 30 miles offshore right out of the water.  Everyone in this country is going to say, oh, it's so great.  That's not great.  That's not great.  I would love to be able to get along with Russia.Now, you've had a lot of Presidents that haven't taken that tact.  Look where we are now.  Look where we are now.  So, if I can -- now, I love to negotiate things.  I do it really well and all that stuff, but it's possible I won't be able to get along with Putin.  Maybe it is.  But I want to just tell you, the false reporting by the media, by you people -- the false, horrible, fake reporting makes it much harder to make a deal with Russia.  And probably Putin said, you know -- he's sitting behind his desk and he's saying, you know, I see what's going on in the United States, I follow it closely; it's got to be impossible for President Trump to ever get along with Russia because of all the pressure he's got with this fake story.  Okay?  And that's a shame.  Because if we could get along with Russia -- and, by the way, China and Japan and everyone -- if we could get along, it would be a positive thing, not a negative thing.Q    Tax reform --Q    Mr. President, since you -- THE PRESIDENT:  Tax reform is going to happen fairly quickly.  We're doing Obamacare -- we're in final stages.  We should be submitting the initial plan in March, early March, I would say.  And we have to, as you know, statutorily and for reasons of budget, we have to go first.  It's not like -- frankly, the tax would be easier, in my opinion, but for statutory reasons and for budgetary reasons, we have to submit the health care sooner.  So we'll be submitting health care sometime in early March, mid-March.  And after that, we're going to come up -- and we're doing very well on tax reform.Yes.Q    Mr. President, you mentioned Russia.  Let's talk about some serious issues that have come up in the last week that you have had to deal with as President of the United States.THE PRESIDENT:  Okay.Q    You mentioned the vessel, the spy vessel, off the coast of the United States.THE PRESIDENT:  Not good.Q    There was a ballistic missile test that many interpreted as a violation -- THE PRESIDENT:  Not good.Q    -- of the agreement between the two countries.  And a Russian plane buzzed a U.S. destroyer.  THE PRESIDENT:  Not good.Q    I listened to you during the campaign -- THE PRESIDENT:  Excuse me, excuse me, when did it happen?  It happened when -- if you were Putin right now, you would say, hey, we're back to the old games with the United States.  There's no way Trump can ever do a deal with us because the -- you have to understand, if I was just brutal on Russia right now, just brutal, people would say, you would say, oh, isn't that wonderful.  But I know you well enough.  Then you would say, oh, he was too tough, he shouldn't have done that.  Look, of all -- Q    I'm just trying to find out your orientation to those -- THE PRESIDENT:  Wait a minute.  Wait, wait.  Excuse me just one second.  Q    I'm just trying to find out what you're doing to do about them, Mr. President.THE PRESIDENT:  All of those things that you mentioned are very recent, because probably Putin assumes that he's not going to be able to make a deal with me because it's politically not popular for me to make a deal.  So Hillary Clinton tries to reset, it failed.  They all tried.  But I'm different than those people.Go ahead.Q    How are you interpreting those moves?  And what do you intend to do about them?THE PRESIDENT:  Just the way I said it.Q    Have you given Rex Tillerson any advice or counsel on how to deal?THE PRESIDENT:  I have.  I have.  And I'm so beautifully represented.  I'm so honored that the Senate approved him.  He's going to be fantastic.Yes, I think that I've already -- Q    Is Putin testing you, do you believe, sir?THE PRESIDENT:  No, I don't think so.  I think Putin probably assumes that he can't make a deal with me anymore because politically it would be unpopular for a politician to make a deal.  I can't believe I'm saying I'm a politician, but I guess that's what I am now.  Because, look, it would be much easier for me to be tough on Russia, but then we're not going to make a deal.Now, I don't know that we're going to make a deal.  I don't know.  We might, we might not.  But it would be much easier for me to be so tough -- the tougher I am on Russia, the better.  But you know what, I want to do the right thing for the American people.  And to be honest, secondarily, I want to do the right thing for the world.If Russia and the United States actually got together and got along -- and don't forget, we're a very powerful nuclear country and so are they.  There's no upside.  We're a very powerful nuclear country and so are they.  I've been briefed.  And I can tell you, one thing about a briefing that we're allowed to say because anybody that ever read the most basic book can say it:  Nuclear holocaust would be like no other.  They're a very powerful nuclear country and so are we.If we have a good relationship with Russia, believe me, that's a good thing, not a bad thing.Q    So when you say they're not good, do you mean that they are -- THE PRESIDENT:  Who did I say is not good?Q    No, when I read off the three things that have recently happened and each one of them you said they're not good.THE PRESIDENT:  No, it's not good, but they happened.Q    But do they damage the relationship?  Do they undermine this country’s ability to work with Russia?THE PRESIDENT:  They all happened recently, and I understand what they’re doing, because they’re doing the same thing.  Now, again, maybe I’m not going to be able to do a deal with Russia, but at least I will have tried.  And if I don’t, does anybody really think that Hillary Clinton would be tougher on Russia than Donald Trump?  Does anybody in this room really believe that?  Okay.But I tell you one thing:  She tried to make a deal.  She had the reset.  She gave all the valuable uranium away.  She did other things.  You know, they say I’m close to Russia.  Hillary Clinton gave away 20 percent of the uranium in the United States.  She’s close to Russia.  I gave -- you know what I gave to Russia?  You know what I gave?  Nothing.Q    Can we conclude there will be no response to these particular provocations?THE PRESIDENT:  I’m not going to tell you anything about what response I do.  I don’t talk about military response.  I don’t say I’m going into Mosul in four months.  ""We are going to attack Mosul in four months.""  Then three months later:  ""We are going to attack Mosul in one month.""  ""Next week, we are going to attack Mosul.""  In the meantime, Mosul is very, very difficult.  Do you know why?  Because I don’t talk about military, and I don’t talk about certain other things.  You’re going to be surprised to hear that.  And, by the way, my whole campaign, I’d say that.  So I don’t have to tell you --Q    There will be a response?THE PRESIDENT:  I don’t want to be one of these guys that say, “Yes, here’s what we’re going to do.”  I don’t have to do that.Q    There will be a -- in other words, there will be a response, Mr. President?  THE PRESIDENT:  I don’t have to tell you what I’m going to do in North Korea.  Wait a minute.  I don’t have to tell you what I’m going to do in North Korea.  And I don’t have to tell you what I’m going to do with Iran.  You know why?  Because they shouldn’t know.  And eventually you guys are going to get tired of asking that question.  So when you ask me, what am I going to do with the ship -- the Russian ship, as an example -- I’m not going to tell you.  But hopefully, I won’t have to do anything.  But I’m not going to tell you.  Okay.Q    Thanks.Q    Can I just ask you -- thank you very much, Mr. President -- the Trump --THE PRESIDENT:  Where are you from?Q    BBC.THE PRESIDENT:  Okay.  Here’s another beauty.Q    That’s a good line.  Impartial, free, and fair.THE PRESIDENT:  Yeah, sure.Q    Mr. President --THE PRESIDENT:  Just like CNN, right?Q    Mr. President, on the travel ban -- we could banter back and forth.  On the travel ban, would you accept that that was a good example of the smooth running of government, that fine-tuned -- THE PRESIDENT:  Yeah, I do.  I do.   And let me tell you about the travel -- Q    Were there any mistakes in that?THE PRESIDENT:  Wait, wait, wait.  I know who you are.  Just wait.  Let me tell you about the travel ban.  We had a very smooth rollout of the travel ban, but we had a bad court.  We got a bad decision.  We had a court that’s been overturned -- again, maybe wrong, but I think it’s 80 percent of the time.  A lot.  We had a bad decision.  We’re going to keep going with that decision.  We’re going to put in a new executive order next week sometime.  But we had a bad decision.  That’s the only thing that was wrong with the travel ban.  You had Delta with a massive problem with their computer system at the airports.  You had some people that were put out there, brought by very nice buses, and they were put out at various locations.  Despite that, the only problem that we had is we had a bad court.  We had a court that gave us what I consider to be, with great respect, a very bad decision.  Very bad for the safety and security of our country.  The rollout was perfect.Now, what I wanted to do was do the exact same executive order but said one thing -- and I said this to my people:  Give them a one-month period of time.  But General Kelly, now Secretary Kelly, said, if you do that, all these people will come in, in the month -- the bad ones.  You do agree, there are bad people out there, right?  They’re not everybody that’s like you.  You have some bad people out there.  So Kelly said, you can’t do that.  And he was right.  As soon as he said it, I said, wow, never thought of it.  I said, how about one week?  He said, no good.  You got to do it immediately, because if you do it immediately, they don’t have time to come in.  Now, nobody ever reports that, but that’s why we did it quickly.Now, if would have done it a month, everything would have been perfect.  The problems is we would have wasted a lot of time, and maybe a lot of lives, because a lot of bad people would have come into our country.Now, in the meantime, we’ve vetting very, very strongly.  Very, very strongly.  But we need help, and we need help by getting that executive order passed.Q    Just a brief follow-up.  And if it’s so urgent, why not introduce --THE PRESIDENT:  Yes, go ahead.Q    Thank you.  I just was hoping that we could get a yes- or-no answer on one of these questions involving Russia.  Can you say whether you are aware that anyone who advised your campaign had contacts with Russia during the course of the election?THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I told you, General Flynn obviously was dealing.  So that’s one person.  But he was dealing -- as he should have been --Q    During the election?THE PRESIDENT:  No, no, nobody that I know of.Q    So you’re not aware of any contacts during the course of the election?THE PRESIDENT:  Look, look, how many times do I have to answer this question?  Q    Can you just say yes or no on it?THE PRESIDENT:  Russia is a ruse.  Yeah, I know you have to get up and ask a question, so important.  Russia is a ruse.  I have nothing to do with Russia, haven’t made a phone call to Russia in years.  Don’t speak to people from Russia.  Not that I wouldn’t, I just have nobody to speak to.  I spoke to Putin twice.  He called me on the election -- I told you this -- and he called me on the inauguration, and a few days ago.  We had a very good talk, especially the second one -- lasted for a pretty long period of time.  I’m sure you probably get it because it was classified, so I’m sure everybody in this room perhaps has it.  But we had a very, very good talk.  I have nothing to do with Russia.  To the best of my knowledge, no person that I deal with does.  Now, Manafort has totally denied it.  He denied it.  Now, people knew that he was a consultant over in that part of the world for a while, but not for Russia.  I think he represented Ukraine or people having to do with Ukraine, or people that -- whoever.  But people knew that.  Everybody knew that.Q    But in his capacity as your campaign manager, was he in touch with Russian officials during the election?THE PRESIDENT:  I have -- you know what, he said no.  I can only tell you what he -- now, he was replaced long before the election.  You know that, right?  He was replaced long before the election.  When all of this stuff started coming out, it came out during the election.  But Paul Manafort, who’s a good man also, by the way -- Paul Manafort was replaced long before the election took place.  He was only there for a short period of time.How much longer should we stay here, folks?  Five more minutes, is that okay?  Five?  Q    Mr. President, on national security --THE PRESIDENT:  Wait, let’s see, who’s -- I want to find a friendly reporter.  Are you a friendly reporter?  Watch how friendly he is.  Wait, wait -- watch how friendly he is.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.Q    So, first of all, my name is (inaudible) from (inaudible) Magazine.  And (inaudible).  I haven’t seen anybody in my community accuse either yourself or any of the -- anyone on your staff of being anti-Semitic.  We have an understanding of (inaudible).THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.Q    However, what we are concerned about, and what we haven’t really heard be addressed is an uptick in anti-Semitism and how the government is planning to take care of it.  There have been reports out that 48 bomb threats have been made against Jewish centers all across the country in the last couple of weeks.  There are people who are committing anti-Semitic acts or threatening to --THE PRESIDENT:  You see, he said he was going to ask a very simple, easy question.  And it’s not.  It’s not.  Not a simple question, not a fair question.  Okay, sit down.  I understand the rest of your question.  So here’s the story, folks.  Number one, I am the least anti-Semitic person that you’ve ever seen in your entire life.  Number two, racism -- the least racist person.  In fact, we did very well relative to other people running as a Republican.  Q    (Inaudible.)THE PRESIDENT:  Quiet, quiet, quiet.  See, he lied about -- he was going to get up and ask a very straight, simple question.  So you know, welcome to the world of the media.  But let me just tell you something -- that I hate the charge.  I find it repulsive.  I hate even the question because people that know me -- and you heard the Prime Minister, you heard Netanyahu yesterday -- did you hear him, Bibi?  He said, I’ve known Donald Trump for a long time, and then he said, forget it.So you should take that, instead of having to get up and ask a very insulting question like that.Yeah, go ahead.  Go ahead.Q    Thank you.  I’m Lisa from the PBS --THE PRESIDENT:  See, it just shows you about the press, but that’s the way the press is.  Q    Thank you, Mr. President.  Lisa Desjardins from the PBS Newshour.THE PRESIDENT:  Good.Q    On national security and immigration, can you give us more details on the executive order you planned for next week, even its broad outlines?  Will it be focused on specific countries?THE PRESIDENT:  It’s a very fair question.Q    And in addition, on the DACA program for immigration, what is your plan?  Do you plan to continue that program or to end it?THE PRESIDENT:  We’re going to show great heart.  DACA is a very, very difficult subject for me, I will tell you.  To me, it’s one of the most difficult subjects I have, because you have these incredible kids, in many cases -- not in all cases.  In some of the cases they’re having DACA and they’re gang members and they’re drug dealers too.  But you have some absolutely incredible kids -- I would say mostly -- they were brought here in such a way -- it's a very, very tough subject.We are going to deal with DACA with heart.  I have to deal with a lot of politicians, don't forget, and I have to convince them that what I'm saying is right.  And I appreciate your understanding on that.But the DACA situation is a very, very -- it's a very difficult thing for me.  Because, you know, I love these kids.  I love kids.  I have kids and grandkids.  And I find it very, very hard doing what the law says exactly to do.  And you know, the law is rough.  I'm not talking about new laws.  I'm talking the existing law is very rough.  It's very, very rough.  As far as the new order, the new order is going to be very much tailored to what I consider to be a very bad decision, but we can tailor the order to that decision and get just about everything, in some ways more.  But we're tailoring it now to the decision.  We have some of the best lawyers in the country working on it.  And the new executive order is being tailored to the decision we got down from the court.  Okay?Q    Mr. President, Melania Trump announced the reopening of the White House Visitors Office.  THE PRESIDENT:  Yes.Q    And she does a lot of great work for the country as well.  Can you tell us a little bit about what First Lady Melania Trump does for the country?  And there is a unique level of interest in your administration, so by opening the White House Visitors Office, what does that mean to you?THE PRESIDENT:  Now, that's what I call a nice question.  That is very nice.  Who are you with?Q    (Inaudible.)THE PRESIDENT:  Good.  I'm going to start watching.  Thank you very much.Melania is terrific.  She was here last night.  We had dinner with Senator Rubio and his wife, who is, by the way, lovely.  And we had a really good discussion about Cuba because we have very similar views on Cuba.  And Cuba was very good to me in the Florida election as you know, the Cuban people, Americans.  And I think that Melania is going to be outstanding.  That's right, she just opened up the Visitors Center -- in other words, touring of the White House.  She, like others that she's working with, feels very, very strongly about women's issues, women's difficulties, very, very strongly.  And she's a very, very strong advocate.  I think she's a great representative for this country.  And a funny thing happens because she gets so unfairly maligned.  The things they say -- I've known her for a long time.  She was a very successful person.  She was a very successful model.  She did really well.  She would go home at night and didn't even want to go out with people.  She was a very private person.  She was always the highest quality that you'll ever find.  And the things they say -- and I've known her for a long time -- the things they say are so unfair.  And actually, she's been apologized to, as you know, by various media because they said things that were lies.I'd just tell you this:  I think she's going to be a fantastic First Lady.  She's going to be a tremendous representative of women and of the people.  And helping her and working with her will be Ivanka, who is a fabulous person and a fabulous, fabulous woman.  And they're not doing this for money.  They're not doing this for pay.  They're doing this because they feel it, both of them.  And Melania goes back and forth, and after Barron finishes school -- because it's hard to take a child out of school with a few months left -- she and Barron will be moving over to the White House.  Thank you.  That's a very nice question.Go ahead.Q    Mr. President.THE PRESIDENT:  Yes.  Oh, this is going to be a bad question but that's okay.Q    No, it's not going to be a bad question.THE PRESIDENT:  Good, because I enjoy watching you on television.Q    Well, thank you so much.  Mr. President, I need to find out from you -- you said something as it relates to inner cities.  That was one of your platforms during your campaign. THE PRESIDENT:  Fix the inner cities, yes.Q    Fixing the inner cities.  What will be that fix and your urban agenda, as well as your HBCU executive order that's coming out this afternoon?  See, it wasn't bad, was it?THE PRESIDENT:  That was very professional and very good.Q    I'm very professional.THE PRESIDENT:  We'll be announcing the order in a little while, and I'd rather let the order speak for itself.  But it will be something I think that will be very good for everybody concerned.  But we'll talk to you about that after we do the announcement.As far as the inner cities, as you know, I was very strong on the inner cities during the campaign.  I think it's probably what got me a much higher percentage of the African American vote than a lot of people thought I was going to get.  We did much higher than people thought I was going to get and I was honored by that, including the Hispanic vote, which was also much higher.  And, by the way, if I might add, including the women's vote, which was much higher than people thought I was going to get.So we are going to be working very hard on the inner cities having to do with education, having to do with crime.  We're going to try and fix as quickly as possible -- you know it takes a long time.  It's taken 100 years or more for some of these places to evolve, and they evolved many of them very badly.But we’re going to be working very hard on health and health care; very, very hard on education.  And also, we’re going to working in a stringent way, and a very good way, on crime.  You go to some of these inner city places, and it’s so sad when you look at the crime.  You have people -- and I’ve seen this, and I’ve sort of witnessed it.  In fact, in two cases, I have actually witnessed it.  They lock themselves into apartments, petrified to even leave, in the middle of the day.  They’re living in hell.  We can’t let that happen.  So we’re going to be very, very strong.It’s a great question, and it’s a very difficult situation, because it’s been many, many years.  It’s been festering for many, many years.  But we have places in this country that we have to fix.  We have to help African American people that, for the most part are stuck there -- Hispanic American people.  We have Hispanic American people that are in the inner cities, and they’re living in hell.I mean, you look at the numbers in Chicago.  There are two Chicagos, as you know.  There’s one Chicago that’s incredible, luxurious and all, and safe.  There’s another Chicago that’s worse than almost any of the places in the Middle East that we talk about, and that you talk about every night on the newscasts.  So we’re going to do a lot of work on the inner cities.  I have great people lined up to help with the inner cities.Q    Well, when you say -- when you say the inner cities, are you going to include the CBC, Mr. President, in your conversations with your urban agenda, your inner city agenda, as well as your --THE PRESIDENT:  Am I going include who?Q    Are you going to include the Congressional Black Caucus and the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, as well as -- THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I would.  I tell you what, do you want to set up the meeting?  Do you want to set up the meeting?Q    No, no, no. THE PRESIDENT:  Are they friends of yours?Q    I’m just a reporter.  THE PRESIDENT:  No, go ahead, set up the meeting.Q    I know some of them, but I’m sure they’re watching right now.THE PRESIDENT:  Let’s go set up a meeting.  I would love to meet with the Black Caucus.  I think it’s great -- the Congressional Black Caucus.  I think it’s great.  I actually thought I had a meeting with Congressman Cummings, and he was all excited, and then he said, oh, I can’t move, it might be bad for me politically, I can’t have that meeting.  I was all set to have the meeting.  You know, we called him and called him, and he was all set.  I spoke to him on the phone.  Very nice guy.Q    I hear he wanted that meeting with you as well.THE PRESIDENT:  He wanted it.  But we called, called, called, called -- they can’t make a meeting with him.  Every day, I walked in, I said, I would like to meet with him.  Because I do want to solve the problem.  But he probably was told by Schumer or somebody like that -- some other lightweight -- he was probably told -- he was probably told, don’t meet with Trump, it’s bad politics.  And that’s part of the problem of this country.Okay, one more.  Go ahead.Q    Yes, Mr. President, two questions --THE PRESIDENT:  No, no.  One question.  Two, we can’t handle.  This room can’t handle two.  Go ahead, give me the better of your two.Q    (Inaudible) it's not about your personality or your beliefs.  We’re talking about (inaudible) around the country, some of it by supporters in your name.  What do you --THE PRESIDENT:  And some of it -- and can I be honest with you?  And this has to do with racism and horrible things that are put up.  Some of it written by our opponents.  You do know that.  Do you understand that?  You don’t think anybody would do a thing like that.  Some of the signs you’ll see are not put up by the people that love or like Donald Trump, they’re put up by the other side, and you think it’s like playing it straight.  No.  But you have some of those signs, and some of that anger is caused by the other side.  They’ll do signs and they’ll do drawings that are inappropriate.  It won’t be my people.  It will be the people on the other side to anger people like you.  Okay.Go ahead.Q    You are the President now.  What are you going to do about it?THE PRESIDENT:  Who is that?  Where is that?  Oh, stand up.  You can --Q    What are you going to do about the tensions that have been discussed?THE PRESIDENT:  Oh, I’m working on it.  No, I’m working on it very hard.  Q    Are you going to give a speech?THE PRESIDENT:  No, no, look.  Hey, just so you understand, we had a totally divided country for eight years, and long before that, in all fairness to President Obama.  Long before President Obama, we have had a very divided.  I didn’t come along and divide this country.  This country was seriously divided before I got here.  We’re going to work on it very hard.  One of the questions that was asked -- I thought it was a very good question -- was about the inner cities.  I mean, that’s part of it.  But we’re going to work on education.  We’re going to work on lack -- you know, we’re going to stop -- we’re going to try and stop the crime.  We have great law enforcement officials.  We’re going to try and stop crime.  We’re not going to try and stop, we’re going to stop crime. But it’s very important to me.  But this isn’t Donald Trump that divided a nation.  We went eight years with President Obama, and we went many years before President Obama.  We lived in a divided nation.  And I am going to try -- I will do everything within my power to fix that.  I want to thank everybody very much.  It’s a great honor to be with y"

I had a lot of good discussions this morning.  I'm negotiating a lot of contracts that are saving billions and billions of dollars for the American people and for all of us, and I'm very proud of it.You know, the F-35 fighter jet, the Air Force One program, which was totally out of control and now it's back where it's supposed to go, and many other things.  In addition, I had a very good phone call this morning about a major plant that's moving back into the United States.  We'll be talking about it soon.  And what I do have is a little free time at about 12 o'clock.  So I don't think the press will want to show up, but I think I'll have a press conference probably at 12 o'clock in the East Room.  We had a little time in between things.  So if the press would like to show up -- will anybody show up to that press conference?  (Laughter.)  Historically, they didn't care about these things.  For me, they show up.  So I think 12 o'clock in the East Room of the White House we'll have a press conference.I just want to thank you folks for coming today.  This was good.  This was scheduled a long time ago -- some of my very, very early supporters.  And I've been your supporter also.  We're doing really well.  The fake-news media doesn't like talking about the economy; I never see anything about the stock market sets new records every day.  I never see it.  But I think the people understand it.  We're giving a speech in Melbourne, Florida on Saturday.  I think it's going to be around 4 o'clock.  and I hear the tickets, you can't get them, but that's okay.  It's better than you have too many, right?  So it's going to be great.  I look forward to that.  So that will be Melbourne at 4 o'clock. I really appreciate you folks.  You folks have been so great.  And right from the beginning, and, Tom, right at the beginning.  Just about every one of you, right at the beginning.  Some of you were a little after the beginning.  (Laughter.)  But we forgive.  But we forgive.  Let's go around, just for the media, and you'll introduce yourselves and then we'll start talking, and I'll see the media back at 12 o'clock. Chris?CONGRESSMAN COLLINS:  Well, Mr. President, we're all honored to be here.

And we’re getting -- I mean, this is the slowest in history, the approval of a Cabinet.  And these people are outstanding people.  The man I’ll be announcing for Labor is a star, great person.  A great person.And so I look forward to that.  But I appreciate everything you've done.  You've been fantastic, and I appreciate that.  Thank you.

THE PRESIDENT:  He played well, I'll tell you.  And you know, we played with Ernie Els.  I called up Billy -- I said, see if you can get me somebody good to play with; I have the Prime Minister of Japan who wants to play golf.  So we get to the front of the club, and Ernie Els is waiting for us.  He said, when you're ready.  So we had a good time.No, he played very nicely, and he’s a great guy.  You're going to like him.  I like him.CONGRESSMAN LONG:  Oh, yeah, I’ve met him the last three or four years -- met with him there.  He’s a great guy.  And I knew you all would hit it off because you're both people persons and a great personalities.THE PRESIDENT:  Well, we had a good feeling.CONGRESSMAN LONG:  So I knew you guys would get along good.THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I always said about President Obama, it’s great to play golf, but play golf with heads of countries.  And, by the way, people like yourself, when you're looking for votes, don't play with your friends who you play with every week.  (Laughter.)  Does that make sense?CONGRESSMAN LONG:  Yeah, it does.THE PRESIDENT:  I hit it off with the Prime Minister.  He is a fabulous guy.  He’s -- loves his country.  And we spoke all day long and well into the night.  As you know, they launched a missile in North Korea, and we were discussing that.  So it was really something.  But have a good time over there.

Fran Drescher, from “The Nanny” -- THE PRESIDENT:  Right. CONGRESSMAN LONG:  -- said you were on “The Nanny” one time.

My daughter came through a successful cancer battle.THE PRESIDENT:  She’s fought hard.  She’s fought hard.  Yes.  You know what, if you would, Billy, why don't you give me that request?

Q    Are you going to find some of those leakers, Mr. President?THE PRESIDENT:  We're going to find the leakers.  We're going to find the leakers.  They're going to pay a big price for leaking.

And Betsy DeVos, who has gone through -- our new Education Secretary -- she went through an interesting moment.  And you're going to do a fantastic job, and I know you would have done it again if you had to do it again, right?  (Laughter.) SECRETARY DEVOS:  Probably.THE PRESIDENT:  She had no doubt that final night, waiting for the vote.  So I just want to congratulate you.  You showed toughness and genius.As I said many times in my campaign, we want every child in America to have the opportunity to climb the ladder to success.  I want every child also to have a safe community, and we're going to do that very much.  We're going to be helping you a lot -- a great school and some day to get a really well-paying job or better, or better; own their own company.  And a lot of people are looking at that.  But it all begins with education, and that's why we're here this morning.  And I'm here also to celebrate a little bit with Betsy because we started this journey a long time ago, having to do with change and so many other good things with education.  And I'm so happy that that all worked out.Right now, too many of our children don't have the opportunity to get that education that we all talk about.  Millions of poor, disadvantaged students are trapped in failing schools and this crisis -- and it really is a crisis -- of education and communities working together but not working out.  And we're going to change it around, especially for the African American communities.  It's been very, very tough and unfair.  And I know that's a priority and it's a certainly a priority of mine.That's why I want every single disadvantaged child in America, no matter what their background or where they live, to have a choice about where they go to school.  And it's worked out so well in some communities where it's been properly run and properly done.  And it's a terrific thing.Charter schools, in particular, have demonstrated amazing gains and results.  And you look at the results -- we have cases in New York City that have been amazing in providing education to disadvantaged children and the success of so many different schools that I can name throughout the country that I got to see during the campaign.  I went to one in Las Vegas; it was the most unbelievable thing you've ever seen.  And they've done a fantastic job.So there are many such schools and we want to do that on a large-scale basis.  We can never lose sight of the connection between education and jobs.  I'm bringing a lot of jobs back.  We're bringing a lot of big plants back into the country -- everyone said it was impossible.  And before I even took office, we started the process and tremendous numbers of plants are coming back into this country -- car plants and other plants.  And I have meetings next week with four or five different companies, big ones that are going to bring massive numbers of jobs back.  So we're doing it from the jobs standpoint, but education only makes it better.  Our goal is a clear and very safe community, great schools, and we want those jobs that are high-paying jobs -- we've lost a lot of our best jobs to other countries and we're going to bring them back.  So I’m going to do my job, and Betsy, at the education level, will do her job.  And just to do it very, very formally, I want to congratulate you on having gone through a very tough trial and a very unfair trial, and you won.  And there’s something very nice about that.  And I’ll tell you the real winner will be the children -- I guess a couple of adults (inaudible) -- but will be the children of this country.  And I just want to congratulate you.SECRETARY DEVOS:  Thank you, Mr. President.THE PRESIDENT:  Perhaps we’ll go around the room.  And everybody knows our fantastic Vice President, Mike Pence.  But if we went around the room, it would be very nice.  So why don’t we start?  Betsy, you might want to say a few words to us.SECRETARY DEVOS:  Well, Mr. President and Mr. Vice President, I am just very honored to have the opportunity to serve America’s students, and I’m really excited to be here today with parents and educators representing traditional public schools, charter public schools, homeschools, private schools, a range of choices.  And we’re eager to listen and learn from you your ideas for how we can ensure that all of our kids have an equal opportunity for a high-quality, great education and therefore an opportunity for the future.So again, I just wanted to have the opportunity to serve, and looking forward to fulfilling the mission that you set forward.THE PRESIDENT:  It’s our honor -- believe me, Betsy.Kenneth.MR. SMITH:  Ken Smith, educator helping at-risk kids get through school.  Vice President, it actually has the largest application of jobs for America’s graduates in the country.  And in a minute we’ll talk about that as a solution.THE PRESIDENT:  Great.  Good.Laura.MS. PARRISH:  Laura Parrish, I’m from Falls Church, Virginia.  I homeschool my 10- and my 13-year-old.

QUENNVILLE:  Well --THE PRESIDENT:  Have you seen an increase in the autism with the children?MS. QUENNVILLE:  Yes, yes.  In fact, our school has shifted its population -- saw more children with autism, definitely.THE PRESIDENT:  So what’s going on with autism?  When you look at the tremendous increases, really, it’s such an incredible -- it’s like really a horrible thing to watch, the tremendous amount of increase.  Do you have any idea?  And you’re seeing it in the school? MS. QUENNVILLE:  Yes, I think -- I mean, I think the statistics, I believe, are 1 in 66, 1 in 68 children are diagnosed with autism.THE PRESIDENT:  And now it’s going to be even lower --MS.

A lot of people wanted that position, Steven.  A lot of people.  A lot of very successful people.  But I've known you for a long time, and I know how smart you are and how great you will be for our country.  So congratulations to you, to Louise, and to your whole family.Americans should know that Steven -- our nation's financial system is truly in great hands.  With him, we're going to have no problem, believe me.  Once again, with this appointment, I am following through on my promise to appoint only the very best and the very brightest. Steven is a financial legend with an incredible track record of success.  I've watched this over the years.  He's been my friend for many, many years.  Everything he's touched has turned to gold.  He's done an amazing job.  And that's what we want for our country.He has distinguished himself through decades of achievement in finance and in banking, and has a degree of skill, talent, and insight that few will ever be able to match.  He has spent his entire career making money in the private sector, and that's okay -- especially when you're Secretary of Treasury.  That's what we want.  Now he will go to work on behalf of the American taxpayer.  To all citizens I say:  Steven will be your champion, and a great champion.  He will fight for middle-class tax reductions, financial reforms that open up lending and create millions of new jobs, and fiercely defend the American tax dollar and our financial security.  And he will also defend our manufacturing jobs from those who cheat and steal and rob us blind.  It won't be that anymore.  We won't have that anymore.  Countries and others won't be able to take advantage of us.  It's a whole new era.Steven knows the system and he will help ensure that Wall Street plays by the rules.  He will use his insights to get the best possible result, most importantly for the American worker.  They've been treated very unfairly for a long time.  Not anymore.  He will put his skills to work for America's working families, and he will help make America the greatest jobs magnet on the face of the Earth.  It will truly be for our country, for the first time in a long time, a rising tide that lifts all boats and that lifts all ships.  Steven, I want to again congratulate you and Louise on this unbelievably high honor.  This is one of the great honors.  I know you will carry your office with dedication, integrity and passion -- tremendous passion.  You have much -- very important work ahead for the American citizens, and you will have absolutely no problem.  He'll work 24 hours a day -- I know him.  He'll work 28 hours a day, if they give the extra four hours.  He will be very, very special.So I'd like to just say, so importantly, God bless you, God bless America, and congratulations.  Thank you, Steven.  (Applause.)  (The Secretary is sworn in.)SECRETARY MNUCHIN:  Mr. President, I want to thank you for this extraordinary opportunity to serve you and the country as the Secretary of Treasury.  It has been a great experience to travel around the country with you for the last year, seeing so many parts of this country and meeting hundreds of business leaders.I share your economic vision and goals, and committed to working with you to enact policies, to grow the economy, and make better economic opportunities for all Americans.I would also like to thank Vice President Pence for the honor of swearing me in and for all your support in this job.  There have been so many people that have helped me in this process, and I want to thank them all as they helped prepare me for the role of Secretary.  And I want to thank them.It's a great honor to follow in the footsteps of Alexander Hamilton and so many great Treasury Secretaries.

2017-02-09;https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/02/09/remarks-president-trump-scotus-listening-session;Remarks by President Trump Before SCOTUS Listening Session;Thank you all for coming.  We had a couple of great meetings this morning -- the airline industry, we're going to get that one going.  They've got a lot of problems but it's going to be good.  We just had talks with Qatar and a couple of countries -- Afghanistan.  I would say that that's a tough situation but we'll do something about it.  We'll be having some -- we'll be giving you some pretty -- information -- pretty good information soon.  We're going to have some good, big conversations with other world leaders over the next few hours.  A lot of things happening, a lot of positive things.I want to start by thanking Senator Manchin for having the courage to vote for somebody that's really very outstanding, really outstanding -- as good as they've seen in a long time.  Nominating the justice to the Supreme Court, a justice, has always been considered one of the very important things that a President can do.  I guess I'm looking very much at defense and we're negotiating a lot of contracts with airlines and a lot of other people, but when you get right down to it, the F-35 Fighter is very important and all of the things we're doing are very important.  But I've always considered, and I guess a lot of people have, the Supreme Court nominees to be right up there -- right up there.  We'll take defense, number one, I think, Senator, we have to go with defense of our country, number one.  And right after that, I suspect it's going to be Supreme Court justices.  And Judge Gorsuch is an exceptionally qualified nominee -- probably there's rarely been anybody that's been more qualified.  He has impeccable academic and legal credentials.  He went to Columbia -- very, very great student.  He went to Harvard, top of his class.  He went to Oxford, great student, great intellect.  He has an outstanding record for 10 years on the bench.  One of the great writers they say -- legal writers -- I've read some of the things that he's written and, believe me, he is a great, great writer.  He'll respect and very much respect the Constitution, as written, and he will apply the law as written.  He's a mainstream judge, very much mainstream, and I urge you all to confirm him.  He's been doing very well.  A lot of people are liking him very much on the other side.  And I think that, because of politics, perhaps they're not going to vote for him.  I think that's a shame because that's not being honest.  I've had a couple of people tell me from the other side -- because, believe it or not, I have a lot of friends on the other side too -- and they think he's outstanding.  And then they go on to tell me that perhaps they won't be able to do that.  But that's one of the reasons that our country is in stagnation in so many different forms and so many different ways.  I think it's very dishonest and I think it's very unfortunate.  But we'll see what happens.  I think he's doing very well.  And I know that some people are going to come on board and hopefully we can do this in a very quick and civil manner.The Cabinet slowly is happening.  Jeff Sessions just got -- you're very happy about that -- because Jeff is outstanding.  And we just swore in Jeff Sessions as Attorney General, and I think he's going to be outstanding.So I just want to thank you all for being here.  We're going to have a good lunch and we're going to talk about our Supreme Court nominee, somebody who will do a fantastic job for many years to come.  Thank you very much.Q    Mr. President, any comment on Judge Gorsuch's comments about you, sir?THE PRESIDENT:  You misrepresented his comments.Q    I just wanted to ask you what your thoughts were, sir.THE PRESIDENT:  His comments were misrepresented.  And what you should do is ask Senator Blumenthal about his Vietnam record that didn't exist after years of saying it did.  So ask Senator Blumenthal about his Vietnam record.  He misrepresented that just like he 
2017-02-09;https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/02/09/remarks-president-trump-meeting-aviation-industry;Remarks by President Trump in Meeting with the Aviation Industry;"Thank you for being here.  Nothing like having meetings in the White House.  Good place.  Good place for meetings.  Good place for a lot of things.  People don’t realize I inherited a mess.  A big mess.  I think they know.  I think they understand.  Well, thank you all.  I know so many of you through reading and through business magazines, and you've done an amazing job.  And I want to congratulate you.  I know you're under pressure from a lot of foreign elements and foreign carriers.  I've been hearing that a little bit.  At the same time, we want to make life good for them also.  They come with big investments -- in many cases, those investments are made by their governments.  But they are still big investments.I'm thrilled to welcome the leaders of the airline industry to the White House.  Your industry supports over 10 million well-paying U.S. jobs and creates almost $1 trillion in economic activity, which is really big stuff, really amazing.  Last year, our airlines moved approximately 2 million people each day in our country, which is an incredible number of people.  And they move them well -- despite the bad equipment that the airports give you in many cases, because they can't get approvals, and we had regulatory morass that's a disaster.And I can tell you that a lot of the new equipment that already is obsolete the day they order it -- and that's according to people that know, including my pilot.  I have a pilot who's a real expert, and he said, sir, the equipment they're putting on is just the wrong stuff.  And we'll talk about that.  Because if we're going to modernize our systems, we should be using the right equipment.  And I know Mr. Tilden is nodding.  You know what I mean.  It's one thing to order equipment, but let's order the right equipment.  Probably the wrong equipment costs more.  You can probably buy the right equipment for less money.  So we want to talk about that.  Because my pilot, he's a smart guy, and knows what's going on.  He said the government is using the wrong equipment and instituting a massive, multibillion-dollar project, but they're using the wrong type of equipment.  So let's find out about that.We want the traveling public to have the greatest customer service, with an absolute minimum of delays and with great convenience all at the lowest possible cost.  We want to help you realize these goals, and we will indeed help you realize these goals.  Airports are very important when you travel.  Very important.  As an example, some of you were saying yesterday to me that you go to China, you go to Japan, they have fast trains all over the place.  We don’t have one.  I don’t want to compete with your business -- (laughter) -- but we don’t have one fast train.  And it's the same thing with our airports.  Our airports used to be the best.  Now they're at the bottom of the rung.  We've spent $6 trillion -- think of it -- as of about two months ago, $6 trillion in the Middle East.  We've got nothing.  We've got nothing.  We never even kept just even a little tiny oil well.  Not one little one.  I said, keep the oil.  But we've spent right now $6 trillion in the Middle East.  We have nothing.  And we have an obsolete plane system, we have obsolete airports, we have obsolete trains.  We have bad roads.  We're going to change all of that, folks.  You're going to be so happy with Trump.  I think you already are.So we want to help you realize these goals by rolling back burdensome regulations.  And you people are regulated probably as much as almost anybody, although I can think of a couple of industries that are even worse.  Lowering the overall tax burden on American businesses big league.  That's coming along very well.  Way ahead of schedule, I believe.  And we're going to be announcing something, I would say, over the next two or three weeks that will be phenomenal in terms of tax, and developing our aviation infrastructure.    Again, I want to thank you all for being here.  So I want this to be a meeting of substance.  I want to be able to do things for you.  The auto industry was in.  They left, they said it was the best meeting they've ever had.  I even took them into the Oval Office.  The head of Ford, the head of General Motors, the head of Fiat, others -- they never saw the Oval Office.  I said, you mean they never took you in?  You see how far away it was from the room?  Ten feet.  It was 10 feet across the hallway, but they never got taken in.  I took them in.  The auto companies are going to be making massive investments in Michigan and Ohio, in Pennsylvania, a lot of the places where jobs have left.  So we’re really happy about that.  They’ve been great.  Ford is going to build -- you know they cancelled a big plant in a certain place, I won’t say where -- a $2 billion plant, and they’re building it in the United States and they’re expanding greatly.  General Motors the same thing.  They’ve been great.  They’ve been great.  I think they’ll continue to be great.But we’re also going to be great to them.  We’re going to get rid of a lot of unnecessary regulation, and we’re going to make their life a lot easier.  They’re going to employ a lot more people.  So a lot of businesses are rushing in.  They’re coming in big league.So with that, I thought what I would do is perhaps we’ll start with Mr. Gray.  We’ll go around the room and just quickly just say who you are and who you represent.  The biggest of the airlines are here.  STAFFER:  Thank you, press.THE PRESIDENT:  And you can -- no, stay, stay, stay.  Let them see who’s here.  (Laughter.)  Everyone is so quick to get rid of the press.  I think I am the most open President ever.  (Laughter.)  They want to get rid of the press.  What, you don’t want to see who Mr. Gray is?  (Laughter.)  Maybe I should have started with somebody else.  (Laughter.)  Okay, you can stay.  Yeah, stay.  Stay for a while.  See who’s here, right?  Okay, good.MR. GRAY:  Well, thank you, Mr. President.  I’m Myron Gray, and I represent the United Parcel Service.  MS. EVENS:  I’m Ginger Evens, I’m the Commissioner of Aviation for the city of Chicago.MR. FLYNN:  Mr. President, Bill Flynn with Atlas Air.MR. WIGINGTON:  Rob Wigington, CEO for Nashville Airport Authority.MR. CALIO:  Nick Calio, Airlines for America.  Thank you for having us.MR. BASTIAN:  Mr. President, Ed Bastian, CEO of Delta Airlines.THE PRESIDENT:  Great.  Welcome.  Delta is doing well.  MR. BASTIAN:  Doing great, and you know we’ve been neighbors for a long time.  THE PRESIDENT:  That’s right.  That’s right, good.  MR. BASTIAN:  Hopefully we've been good to you.THE PRESIDENT:  You've been very good.  Thank you.  MR. HAYES:  Mr. President, Robin Hayes, CEO of JetBlue Airways.  (Inaudible.) THE PRESIDENT:  Good job.MR. BRONCZEK:  Mr. President, Dave Bronczek, FedEx.THE PRESIDENT:  By the way, Fred Smith was here yesterday.MR. BRONCZEK:  Yes, I know.THE PRESIDENT:  He's a great, great guy.MR. KELLY:  Gary Kelly, Southwest Airlines.THE PRESIDENT:  Great job.  MR. TILDEN:  Brad Tilden, Alaska Air Group.  And we’re actually in the process of merging with Virgin America right now.THE PRESIDENT:  Okay, good.MR. FOYE:  Mr. President, Pat Foye, Executive Director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.  THE PRESIDENT:  Great.  We spoke a long time ago.MR. FOYE:  Yes, sir.THE PRESIDENT:  And you did a good job. MR. FOYE:  Thank you.THE PRESIDENT:  Appreciate it.MR. POTTER:  Mr. President, Jack Potter, Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority.  MR. BURKE:  Mr. President, Kevin Burke.  I’m the President of Airports Council International-North America, which is every airports in the United States and Canada.  Thank you for having us.  THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.MR. VANECEK:  Mr. President, Bill Vanecek.  I'm the Director of Aviation for the Buffalo Niagara International Airport and Niagara Falls International Airport.  I'm also the chairman of Airports Council International-NA.THE PRESIDENT:  Great.  MR. LOPANO:  Mr. President, good morning.  My name is Joe Lopano.  I’m from Tampa International Airport.  MR. MUÑOZ:  Oscar Muñoz with United Airlines.  And Mr. Doug Parker from American couldn’t be here today.THE PRESIDENT:  Okay.  Thank you.MS. FLINT:  Good morning, Mr. President.  Deborah Flint, the CEO of Los Angeles World Airports.  LAX is the world’s seventh largest airport and the country’s third largest airport.THE PRESIDENT:  We’ll make it number one worldwide.  Let’s make it number one.  (Laughter.)  I didn’t like the number.  What is number one now in terms of service?MS. FLINT:  Atlanta.THE PRESIDENT:  That’s good.  We love the state of Georgia.  I love Georgia -- I tell you that’s for sure.  So that’s good.PARTICIPANT:  Number one in the world.THE PRESIDENT:  So let me ask you -- so what can we do to make your airlines better, to make your balance sheet better, to have you get more jobs and create more jobs, to have you win competition worldwide so you can start doing more business worldwide?  Because I know you have a lot of competition, and a lot of that competition is subsidized by governments, big league.  I’ve heard that complaint from different people in this room.  Probably about one hour after I got elected I was inundated with calls from your industry, and many other industries, because it’s a pretty unfair situation.What can we do?  Give me suggestions that we can make your life easier and that you can employ a lot more people. MR. KELLY:  Well, Mr. President, I'll lead this off.THE PRESIDENT:  Southwest Airlines.  MR. KELLY:  Thank you very much for the opportunity to be here.  We have never had a meeting like this, certainly in my years at Southwest Airlines.  So we’re very grateful for this opportunity.  THE PRESIDENT:  I want to congratulate you because you have done an amazing job, really amazing job.  You really have.  So congratulations.  Go ahead.MR. KELLY:  I think we’re very well aligned with your philosophy.  We would welcome tax reform.  We would welcome regulatory reform.  And very well aligned on the need for infrastructure investment.  The single biggest opportunity for aviation is to modernize the air traffic control system.  We work very well with our partners in the airports around the table.  I know them all and we serve all of these airports and --THE PRESIDENT:  You shouldn't know them too well.  (Laughter.)  MR. KELLY:  Well, they’re our landlords.  (Laughter.)  (Inaudible) the only landlord available.  But we have billions of dollars’ worth of airport projects underway around the country to continue to modernize the airports.  We've spent billions of dollars on the air traffic control modernization but it’s not making any meaningful progress.THE PRESIDENT:  I hear that.  I hear we have the wrong system.  I’m hearing that the United States government -- and is the gentleman who’s the head of the FAA right now not a pilot?  Or is that -- does he --MR. KELLY:  I don’t know if he’s a pilot or not.THE PRESIDENT:  I’d like to find out because I think it maybe would be good to have a pilot, like a really good pilot who knows what’s going on.  I’ve heard that, and, I don't know, it seems a little hard to believe because the complexity of your business is right up there, right?MR. KELLY:  Oh, very much so.THE PRESIDENT:  And I would think you need a very sophisticated person in that job, and somebody that, frankly -- being a pilot would be helpful, because I’m hearing you put the wrong -- I hear the government contracted this system that’s the wrong system, and I hear that from pilots.  So who would be better to tell me?  But I hear we’re spending billions and billions of dollars.  It’s a system that’s totally out of whack.  It’s way over budget, it’s way beyond schedule, and when it’s completed, it’s not going to be a good system.  Other than that, it’s okay.  (Laughter.) So what do you think about that, Gary?MR. KELLY:  Well, I agree with you.  When you have a project that takes that long, it becomes outdated.THE PRESIDENT:  It’s already outdated.MR. KELLY:  It’s already outdated, no question.  And we spent billions of dollars on this.THE PRESIDENT:  Has that been you or the government or both?PARTICIPANT:  Oh no, this is the federal -- FAA, air traffic control --THE PRESIDENT:  So when you say “we” -- “we” the government --MR. KELLY:  You’re paying for it.  You’re ultimately -- the airlines and our customers are paying for it.THE PRESIDENT:  Why do the airlines allow that to happen where they put in a bad system?  Not even antiquated -- and it’s antiquated because it’s taken so long.  Why do the airlines allow a system that you know is bad from the beginning -- because you guys are pros -- why do they allow the government to put in the wrong system?MR. KELLY:  Well, we’re not in control.  And I think that’s one of the things that we see as the path to having success, is we need to address the fundamental organization of the air traffic organization, not the safety and regulatory oversight -- that’s a government function that needs to remain.  But we believe that reforming the FAA by creating a non-for-profit corporation is the way to address the governments that you’re speaking to, as well as the long-term financing.THE PRESIDENT:  Headed by the airlines?  Headed by who?  The board would be who?MR. KELLY:  The board would be represented by all the various constituents.  So the government would have a seat, general aviation would have a seat, certainly the commercial airlines would have a seat.  Everyone would --THE PRESIDENT:  Well, this wouldn’t have happened then.  You wouldn’t be putting in a system -- a control system -- that is obsolete before they even signed the contract.  And, by the way, overly expensive.  More expensive than (inaudible).  MR. KELLY:  You know, the interesting thing is I think that there is absolutely unanimous agreement that the system needs to be modernized and that it is well behind schedule.  There is not agreement on the path forward to address that, and that’s where we run into roadblocks.  We want the government out of managing the air traffic control system so that it can be adequately managed, adequately financed, and we can get this done.  We won World War II in three-and-a-half years; we ought to be able to modernize air traffic control.THE PRESIDENT:  So how long would it take to -- because I’m hearing you have to scrap all of the billions of dollars that have been put in -- stupidly put in.  How long would it take to come up with a great air traffic control system, the top anywhere in the world, the top of the line?  How long would that take to do and how much would it cost?MR. KELLY:  The good news is, we don’t have to scrap everything.  We are still using fundamentally World War II-era ground-based radar to guide the aircraft from a navigation standpoint.  We are not utilizing GPS satellite-delivered navigational tools.  Those things exist.  At least for Southwest Airlines, we have fully equipped all of our fleet to take advantage of that, but we’re not getting those kinds of flight profiles written for each airport or each route.THE PRESIDENT:  So you'd save a lot of time, you'd save a tremendous amount of fuel.MR. KELLY:  We think that we're losing $25 billion a year as an industry.  And I think the best example we can offer up to you -- the system is very safe, by the way.  And our air traffic controllers are very fine men and women, and they do a fantastic job. THE PRESIDENT:  It's safe but it's very cautious.  And it should be cautious.MR. KELLY:  Yes, it must be cautious.THE PRESIDENT:  But I notice the intervals when planes go out seem very, very long.MR. KELLY:  It used to be a 55-minute trip between Washington and New York, and today it's 80.  PARTICIPANT:  Mr. President, it's not just about fuel -- it's about jobs.  The partnership in New York City did a study that the cost of air traffic control congestion in New York and New Jersey alone is $75 billion over a period ending in 2028.  Those are jobs that haven't been created and jobs that -- THE PRESIDENT:  And what is the reason for that?PARTICIPANT:  It's the antiquated system, one, Mr. President.  It's, two, the fact that New York/New Jersey is the busiest airspace in the world.  And, three, frankly, that other countries, including Canada, have more efficient systems.  Implementation and the funding NextGen is really critical.  And this is not an act of (inaudible) -- this is about jobs.PARTICIPANT:  Sir, you asked why -- your question -- how did we let this happen to some degree.THE PRESIDENT:  Yeah.PARTICIPANT:  I've (inaudible) on telecom and railroads and some (inaudible) industry, and it's unfortunate that every time you go from one industry to the other, the regulatory burden continues or gets worse.  So in this particular case, to be very frank and blunt, and to your point earlier, I think it's become political -- it's a political process, and so it's difficult for us to have control.THE PRESIDENT:  Not anymore it's not political.  We're going to get -- PARTICIPANT:  And you have the appointees that you --  THE PRESIDENT:  -- at a reasonable price.  So not anymore.  Go ahead.PARTICIPANT:  I would take special care in reappointing the (inaudible) on the FAA.  Whether or not it needs to be a pilot or not, I can't opine, but it would be nice to have people that actually have a thorough understanding of the business of aviation.THE PRESIDENT:  Is the head of the FAA a pilot?  Does anybody know?  Somebody should know.  PARTICIPANT:  He's not.THE PRESIDENT:  He's not?  He's not a pilot.  I just think a non-pilot would not know the sophistication of this system, right?  I mean, better to have a pilot -- because my pilot said it's a terrible system that they're installing; that the work they're doing now is a waste of tremendous amounts of money because the system is a bad system.  That's coming from a pilot.  PARTICIPANT:  Mr. President, when you talk about jobs, and you just recently asked about that, what we talked about just recently with the airlines is infrastructure in the sky, which is really antiquated.  But you refer to infrastructure on the ground, the airports.THE PRESIDENT:  Both.PARTICIPANT:  Yeah, and the airports really are becoming antiquated, to your point.  There is a system, there is a charge called a passenger-facility charge, which is a charge that's levied on every ticket.  And it hasn't been increased in 16 years, so it's basically defunded.  THE PRESIDENT:  How much is it?PARTICIPANT:  It's $4.50.  That could be increased by a simple act of Congress, and it's not a U.S. tax.  It's a user fee.  So as a customer uses my airport in Tampa, the airlines collect that fee and they send it back to us in Tampa.  It never comes to Washington and gets approved in the budget.THE PRESIDENT:  The problem is, I don't like raising fees or taxes -- I'll be honest.  I mean, we're spending all this money overseas, we're giving away trillions of dollars to all these countries.  All of the countries that trade with us are ripping us off.  The last thing we have to do is raise the fee.  I understand what you're saying, but $4.50 -- it's a lot when you look at all of the passengers.  If there were other ways of doing this -- because you're only hurting yourself by -- really, eventually, people are going to just stop flying because it's very expensive with all the taxes.  I mean, there are other ways.  We're spending so much money overseas, fighting wars, doing things, and, frankly, making horrible trade deals.  So don't worry about the money.  I'll be able to get the money. "

2017-02-08;https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/02/08/remarks-president-trump-mcca-winter-conference;Remarks by President Trump at MCCA Winter Conference;"Thank you very much.  This is -- great to be with people I truly feel comfortable with.  Please sit down.  They’ll say I didn’t get a standing ovation because they never sat down.  (Laughter.)  And I say, I got one standing ovation because they never sat down.  But I want to thank you.  I have great, great love for what you do and the way you do it.  And when I’m with the police chiefs and I’m with the sheriffs of our country -- and these are the big ones.  These are the really big ones.  I just want to thank you very much.  And I thought before I spoke about what we’re really here to speak about, I would read something to you.  Because you can be a lawyer, or you don’t have to be a lawyer; if you were a good student in high school or a bad student in high school, you can understand this.  And it’s really incredible to me that we have a court case that’s going on so long.  As you know, in Boston, we won it with a highly respected judge and a very strong opinion, but now we’re in an era that, let’s just say, they are interpreting things differently than probably 100 percent of the people in this room.  I’d like to almost know, does anybody disagree when I read this.But I’m going to read what’s in dispute, what’s in question.  And you will see this -- it’s INA 212(f) 8 U.S.C. 1182(f):  “Suspension of entry or imposition of restrictions by the President” -- okay, now, this isn’t just me, this is for Obama, for Ronald Reagan, for the President.  And this was done, very importantly, for security -- something you people know more about than all of us.  It was done for the security of our nation, the security of our citizens, so that people come in who aren’t going to do us harm.And that’s why it was done.  And it couldn’t have been written any more precisely.  It’s not like, oh, gee, we wish it were written better.  It was written beautifully.  So just listen, here’s what it says.  This is what they’re arguing:  ""Whenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens"" -- okay, the entry, the entry of any aliens -- ""or of any class of aliens"" -- so any aliens, any class of aliens -- ""into the United States"" -- so the entry of people into the United States.  Let’s say, just to be precise, of aliens into the United States.  So any time -- ""whenever the President finds that the entry of any alien or any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States"" -- right?  So if I find, as President, that a person or group of people will be detrimental to the interests of the United States -- and certainly there’s lots of examples that we have, but you shouldn’t even have them, necessarily -- he may be -- and ""he may by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary…""  Now, the only mistake is they should have said ""he or she.""  But hopefully, it won’t be a she for at least another seven years.  After that, I’m all -- (laughter and applause.)  See?  I just noticed that, actually.  I just noticed it.  I’m saying, whoa, this is not politically correct.  It’s correct, but it’s not politically correct, you know, this is the old days.He may by proclamation and for such period as he shall deem necessary -- so here it is, people coming in -- suspend the entry of all aliens.  Right?  That’s what it says.  It’s not like -- again, a bad high school student would understand this.  Anybody would understand this.  Suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or non-immigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens.  Okay, so you can suspend the aliens, right?  You can suspend the aliens from coming in -- very strong -- or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate.Okay.  So you can suspend, you can put restrictions, you can do whatever you want.  And this is for the security of the country -- which, again, you’re the chiefs, you’re the sheriffs.  You understand this.  And I listened to lawyers on both sides last night, and they were talking about things that had just nothing to do with it.  I listened to a panel of judges, and I’ll comment on that -- I will not comment on the statements made by certainly one judge.  But I have to be honest that if these judges wanted to, in my opinion, help the court in terms of respect for the court, they'd what they should be doing.  I mean, it’s so sad.  They should be -- when you read something so simple and so beautifully written, and so perfectly written -- other than the one statement, of course, having to do with he or she -- but when you read something so perfectly written and so clear to anybody, and then you have lawyers and you watched -- I watched last night in amazement, and I heard things that I couldn’t believe, things that really had nothing to do with what I just read.  And I don’t ever want to call a court biased, so I won’t call it biased.  And we haven’t had a decision yet.  But courts seem to be so political, and it would be so great for our justice system if they would be able to read a statement and do what’s right.  And that has to do with the security of our country, which is so important.Right now, we are at risk because of what happened.  General Kelly is an extremely talented man and a very good man -- now Secretary Kelly, Homeland Security.  We are doing our job.  He’s a great man.  (Applause.)  We’re doing our job.  And one of the reasons you probably heard that we did it so quickly -- in fact, I said, let’s give a one-month notice, and then law enforcement -- and General Kelly was so great because he said, we totally knew about it.  We knew about everything.  We do things well.  We did things right.But the law enforcement people said to me, oh, you can’t give a notice, because if you give a notice that you’re going to be really tough in one month from now, or in one week from now -- I suggested a month and I said, well, what about a week?  They said, no, you can’t do that, because then people are going to pour in before the toughness goes on.  Do you people agree?  I mean, you know more about law than anybody, law enforcement.  (Applause.)  So I wanted to give, like, a month.  Then I said, well, what about a week?  They said, well, then you’re going to have a whole pile of people perhaps -- perhaps -- with very evil intentions coming in before the restrictions. So there it is, folks.  It’s as plain as you can have it.  I didn’t -- and I was a good student.  I understand things.  I comprehend very well, okay?  Better than I think almost anybody.  And I want to tell you, I listened to a bunch of stuff last night on television that was disgraceful.  It was disgraceful.  Because what I just read to you is what we have, and it just can’t be written any plainer or better.  And for us to be going through this -- and, by the way, a highly, highly respected judge in Boston ruled very strongly in our favor.  You heard that.In fact, I said to my people, why don’t you use the Boston case?  And there were reasons why they couldn’t use the Boston case.  This one came later for various reasons.  But use the Boston case.  And I won’t read that, but there were statements made by that judge -- who, again, highly respected -- that were right on.  They were perfect.  They were perfect.So I think it’s sad.  I think it’s a sad day.  I think our security is at risk today.  And it will be at risk until such time as we are entitled and get what we are entitled to as citizens of this country.  As chiefs, as sheriffs of this country, we want security.  One of the reasons I was elected was because of law and order and security.  It’s one of the reasons I was elected.  Also jobs and lots of other things.  But I think one of the strongest reasons is security.  And they’re taking away our weapons one by one, that’s what they’re doing.  And you know it and I know it, and you people have been very unhappy for a long period of time.  And I can read the polls maybe better than anybody because it seems that I understood the polls a lot better than many of the pollsters understood the polls -- assuming they were honest polls, which I think probably many of them weren’t.  I really believe that.  (Applause.)But we need security in our country.  We have to allow you folks to do your job.  You’re great people, great people.  Great men and women.  And we have to allow you to do your job.  And we have to give you the weapons that you need.  And this is a weapon that you need.  And they’re trying to take it away from you, maybe because of politics or maybe because of political views.  We can’t let that happen.So with that, let’s get on to business, right?  It’s really something.  Thank you.  (Applause.)  I want to thank Sheriff Sandra Hutchens and Chief Tom Manger for your leadership and, frankly, for the service.  You have had great service.  Everyone has told me about you two legendary people.  All of us here today are united by one shared mission:  to serve and protect the public of the United States.  During my campaign for President, I had the chance to spend time with law enforcement officials all across our country.  They are the most incredible people you will ever meet.  And I just wanted to say to all of them right now, from the bottom of my heart, thank you, thank you, thank you.  (Applause.)  There are many actions we in the federal government can take to help improve safety in your communities.  But I believe that community safety begins with moral leadership.  Our police officers, sheriffs and deputies risk their lives every day.  And they’re entitled to an administration that has their back.  (Applause.)  The first step in restoring public safety is affirming our confidence in the men and women charged with upholding our laws.  And I’m going to add justices, judges in that category.  And I’m very proud to have picked Judge Gorsuch, who I think is going to be an outstanding member of the Supreme Court -- outstanding.  (Applause.)  So I’d like to begin my remarks with a declaration issued to all of you, and delivered to every member of the law enforcement community all across the United States.  My message today is that you have a true, true friend in the White House.  You have.  (Applause.)  I stand with you.  I support our police.  I support our sheriffs.  And we support the men and women of law enforcement.  (Applause.)  Right now, many communities in America are facing a public safety crisis.  Murders in 2015 experienced their largest single-year increase in nearly half a century.  In 2016, murders in large cities continued to climb by double digits.  In many of our biggest cities, 2016 brought an increase in the number of homicides, rapes, assaults and shootings.  In Chicago, more than 4,000 people were shot last year alone, and the rate so far this year has been even higher.  What is going on in Chicago?  We cannot allow this to continue.  We’ve allowed too many young lives to be claimed -- and you see that, you see that all over -- claimed by gangs, and too many neighborhoods to be crippled by violence and fear.  Sixty percent of murder victims under the age of 22 are African American.  This is a national tragedy, and it requires national action.  This violence must end, and we must all work together to end it.Whether a child lives in Detroit, Chicago, Baltimore, or anywhere in our country, he or she has the right to grow up in safety and in peace.  No one in America should be punished because of the city where he or she is born.  Every child in America should be able to play outside without fear, walk home without danger, and attend a school without being worried about drugs or gangs or violence.So many lives and so many people have been cut short.  Their potential, their life has been cut short.  So much potential has been sidelined.  And so many dreams have been shattered and broken, totally broken.  It’s time to stop the drugs from pouring into our country.  And, by the way, we will do that.  And I will say this:  General, now Secretary, Kelly will be the man to do it, and we will give him a wall.  And it will be a real wall.  (Applause.)  And a lot of things will happen very positively for your cities, your states, believe me.  The wall is getting designed right now.  A lot of people say, oh, oh, Trump was only kidding with the wall.  I wasn’t kidding.  I don’t kid.  I don’t kid.  I watch this, and they say I was kidding.  No, I don’t kid.  I don’t kid about things like that, I can tell you.  No, we will have a wall.  It will be a great wall, and it will do a lot of -- will be a big help.  Just ask Israel about walls.  Do walls work?  Just ask Israel.  They work -- if it’s properly done.  It’s time to dismantle the gangs terrorizing our citizens, and it’s time to ensure that every young American can be raised in an environment of decency, dignity, love and support.  You have asked for the resources, tools and support you need to get the job done.  We will do whatever we can to help you meet those demands.  That includes a zero tolerance policy for acts of violence against law enforcement.  (Applause.)  We all see what happens.  We all see what happens and what’s been happening to you.  It’s not fair.  We must protect those who protect us.  The number of officers shot and killed in the line of duty last year increased by 56 percent from the year before.  Last year, in Dallas, police officers were targeted for execution –- think of this.  Who ever heard of this?  They were targeted for execution.  Twelve were shot and five were killed.  These heroic officers died as they lived -– protecting the innocent, rushing into danger, risking their lives for people they did not even know, but for people that they were determined to save.  Hats off to you people.These slain officers are an eternal monument to all of the men and women who protect our streets and serve our public.  We will not forget them, and we will not forget all of the others who made that final sacrifice in the line of duty.God has blessed our nation to put these heroes among us.  Those who serve in law enforcement work long hours.  You work long hours.  I know so many sheriffs, so many chiefs, so many police who work long hours and dangerous hours, oftentimes in difficult conditions and for not that much pay relative to what you’re doing.  They do it because they care.  We must work with them, not against them.  They’re working against you.  For many years they’ve been working against you.  We must support them, not undermine them.  And instead of division and disunity -- and which is so much disunity -- we must build bridges of partnership and of trust.  Those who demonize law enforcement or who use the actions of a few to discredit the service of many are hurting the very people they say that they want to help.  When policing is reduced, crime is increased, and our poorest citizens suffer the most.  And I see it all the time.  When the number of police goes down, crime goes up.To build needed trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve, it is not enough for us to merely talk to each other.  We must listen to each other.  All of us share the view that those in uniform must be held to the highest possible standard of conduct -- so important.  You're the role models to young Americans all across this country, many of whom want to go into law enforcement, many of whom want to be a sheriff or a police chief, many of whom -- they have great respect for you.  Tremendous respect.  You don't even realize it, but I will tell you, they have great respect and admiration for the people in this room and the people that you represent.  And don't let anyone ever tell you different.  Don't let the dishonest media try and convince you that it's different than that, because it's not.  (Applause.)That is why our commitment to law and law enforcement also includes ensuring that we are giving departments the resources they need to train, recruit and retain talent.  As part of our commitment to safe communities, we will also work to address the mental health crisis.  Prisons should not be a substitute for treatment.  We will fight to increase access to life-saving treatment to battle the addiction to drugs, which is afflicting our nation like never ever before -- ever.  (Applause.)I've been here two weeks.  I've met a lot of law enforcement officials.  Yesterday, I brought them into the Oval Office.  I asked a group, what impact do drugs have in terms of a percentage on crime?  They said, 75 to 80 percent.  That's pretty sad.  We're going to stop the drugs from pouring in.  We're going to stop those drugs from poisoning our youth, from poisoning our people.  We're going to be ruthless in that fight.  We have no choice.  (Applause.)And we're going to take that fight to the drug cartels and work to liberate our communities from their terrible grip of violence.  You have the power and knowledge to tell General Kelly -- now Secretary Kelly -- who the illegal immigrant gang members are.  Now, you have that power because you know them, you're there, you're local.  You know the illegals, you know them by their first name, you know them by their nicknames.  You have that power.  The federal government can never be that precise.  But you're in the neighborhoods -- you know the bad ones, you know the good ones.  I want you to turn in the bad ones.  Call Secretary Kelly's representatives and we'll get them out of our country and bring them back where they came from, and we'll do it fast.  You have to call up the federal government, Homeland Security, because so much of the problems -- you look at Chicago and you look at other places.  So many of the problems are caused by gang members, many of whom are not even legally in our country.  And we will work with you on the frontlines to keep America safe from terrorism, which is what I began this with.  Terrorism -- a tremendous threat, far greater than people in our country understand.  Believe me.  I've learned a lot in the last two weeks.  And terrorism is a far greater threat than the people of our country understand.  But we're going to take care of it.  We're going to win.  We're going to take care of it, folks.Let today be the beginning of a great national partnership.  Let today serve as a great call to action.  And let this moment represent a new beginning in relations between law enforcement and our communities.  I want you to know the American public totally stands with you.  I want you to know the American people support you.  I want you to know how proud we are, truly proud, to know you.  We applaud your efforts.  We thank you for your service.  And we promise that you will always find an open door at the White House -- an open invitation to our great cops and sheriffs nationwide.  They're great people.  You are great people.Thank you.  God bless you.  And God bless Am"
2017-02-07;https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/02/07/remarks-president-trump-roundtable-county-sheriffs;Remarks by President Trump in Roundtable with County Sheriffs;"Oh, the sheriffs are great people.  Well, thank you very much.  Law enforcement was a big subject in the campaign and a subject that was very well received.  You have no idea how respected you are, sheriffs and, generally speaking, the leaders of law enforcement.  Anybody involved in law enforcement, you have no idea how respected you are -- you don't get the honest facts from the press -- if you don't know how respected you are.  So I just want to say that upfront.  I’m honored to welcome the National Sheriffs' Association.  Your leadership is here, and I know the great job you do.  I’ve known you and followed you for a long period of time.  Your efforts and your officers are outstanding.  I know so many sheriffs from my area -- some in particular -- and they're great friends and great people.  I just want to let you know that our job is to help you in law enforcement, and we're going to help you do your job.  We're going to expand access to abuse-deterring drugs, which a lot of you have been talking about.  They're out, and they're very hard to get.  Stop the opioid epidemic.  We've got to do it.  It’s a new thing.  And, honestly, people aren’t talking about it enough.  It’s a new thing, and it’s a new problem for you folks.  It’s probably a vast majority of your crimes -- or at least a very big portion of your crimes are caused by drugs.We're going to stop the border.  We're going to stop -- we're not going to have the drugs pouring from the border like they have been.  We will work with you on supporting your longstanding efforts to strengthen the bonds between the communities and the police, which is very important.  And it’s sort a new phenomenon to a certain extent, and it’s happening more and more.  And some great results out when you can strengthen the bonds.We're committed to securing our borders to reduce crime, illegal drugs, human trafficking, especially in border counties.  We have a lot of the border counties represented.  We're also committed to working with law enforcement to stop terrorist attacks.  You've been reading about that, been seeing about that -- they want to take a lot of our powers away.  There are some people with a lot of the wrong intentions, and it's -- we've got a lot of bad people out there. And, Dana, I just want to thank you on behalf of the government, on behalf of our country for leading a strong, strong effort in the courts.  We really appreciate it, believe me.  Because as you know, we don't have an attorney general.  We have somebody who's phenomenal -- Jeff Sessions.  He’s going to be there hopefully soon.  But I believe it’s about a record for the length of time that they’ve delayed the Cabinet.  These are Cabinet members that are phenomenal people.  And we haven’t had representation, and now we have excellent representation, fortunately, in Dana.  And Jeff will be with you very shortly, hopefully.  But we're having a hard time getting approvals.  And it’s only a delay tactic -- it’s all politics.  One person came up to me, a senator, a Democratic senator who came up to me the other day and said, Jeff Sessions is a fantastic man.  He’s fabulous.  He’s a friend of mine.  He’s a great, great man and a great talent.  And we're lucky to have him.  I said, oh, great, I guess that means you're voting for him?  No, I won’t be voting that.  (Laughter.)  He said, politics doesn't allow me to do that.  I thought it was a disgrace.  If the press talks loud and hard enough, I’ll have to tell you who said that to me.  You don't want to hear it.  You don't want to hear who said that?  (Laughter.)  I didn't think you’d care.  I didn't think you’d care.  I’ll probably tell you, actually.  Anyway.  So we're going to be very tough on crime.  So we're going to be very tough on the drugs pouring in, and that's a big part of the crime.  We're going to be very strong at the border.  We have no choice.  And we're going to be building a wall.   We're starting very soon.  General Kelly will be working with a lot of you.  And he’s fantastic.  He was the one who got approved very quickly along with General Mattis.  He’s very, very outstanding.  And I very much appreciate that you're here today.  And, Sheriff, I really thank you for leading the effort.  Your reputation is fantastic, and it’s a great honor to know you.  Maybe we can go around -- we’ll let the press stay for a little while, unless you’d rather leave.  Would the press rather stay?  Just so you understand.  This is a new phenomenon.  You're on live television all over the world right now, so don't get nervous when you speak, okay?  (Laughter.)  But I don't think these things have ever taken place before.  But you are on live television, so if you don't want to say anything, you don't have to.  But if you do, I think it’s a good thing to say.  So maybe we’ll just go around the room.SHERIFF WELSH:  Well, Mr. President, thank you so much for having us here.  I’m Sheriff Carolyn Welsh from Chester County, Pennsylvania, and proud to say Pennsylvania, the commonwealth, that put you over the top November 8th.THE PRESIDENT:  It’s true.  (Laughter.) SHERIFF WELSH:  We're very proud of that.  We don't stop bragging about that. THE PRESIDENT:  You were a great support.SHERIFF WELSH:  Thank you.  And I just want to thank you for, during the campaign and since the campaign, being such a strong, courageous supporter of law enforcement on the national -- on the federal level with the Border Patrol, on the state level, and the counties, municipalities, boroughs, and particularly with the elected sheriffs of the counties -- because we are the sheriff, we are the people’s representative, and we are elected by the people, and we greatly appreciate your strong and continued support.THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Carolyn.  There’s a new sheriff in town.  SHERIFF WELSH:  That's right.  THE PRESIDENT:  I hear this so much.  (Laughter.)  I hear this so much, Dana.  They always use, ""there’s a new sheriff in town.""  So anyway. SHERIFF EAVANSON:  Sheriff Harold Eavanson from Rockwall County, Texas.  We appreciate your support very much.  Our county is probably about 85 percent Republican.  So it was pretty easy for you -- THE PRESIDENT:  They were very nice.  I agree.  They were very nice.SHERIFF EAVANSON:  And being in a border state, I have been to the border in Texas any number of times, been to the border in Arizona.  I clearly understand the problem we have.  And previously when we’d go to the border and hear what the ranchers and sheriffs have to say -- those border sheriffs and border ranchers, it was a 180 degrees from what we heard from the previous administration.  THE PRESIDENT:  So you're seeing a big difference?  SHERIFF EAVANSON:  We're very proud to have you as President. THE PRESIDENT:  And that's only two weeks.  Okay?  It’s a very short period of time.  I’m hearing it from a lot of people.  People are calling in and they're -- and people I know that are in the area, they're saying it’s like day and night.  Because we're not playing games.  We're not playing games.  We're stopping the drugs from pouring into our country and poisoning our youth.  So thank you very much.  I appreciate it.SHERIFF EAVANSON:  You're welcome.MR. THOMPSON:  Mr. President, I’m Jonathan Thompson, the executive director and CEO of the National Sheriffs’ Association.  Let me tell you the difference of six months.  I sat in this room, in this chair, and I was pleading -- I was begging for help.  Today, you’ve invited us here to your home.  You're offering help.  You're delivering on that offer.  And on behalf of our members across the country, thank you. THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  It’s so nice.  I appreciate that.  SHERIFF STANEK:  Mr. President, Rich Stanek from Hennepin County, Minneapolis, Minnesota. First off, thank you very much.  As Ms. Conway said, next time, up by three points in my state -- over the top.THE PRESIDENT:  Boy, we almost won your state.  You know we weren't supposed to do very well in your state, and we won -- lost by one point.  I say, if I went there one more visit we would have won.  (Laughter.)  We would have won Minnesota.  But it was very close.  SHERIFF STANEK:  Many of us have your back, Mr. President.THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, I know.SHERIFF STANEK:  And I just want to say that you hit on two topics that are near and dear to my heart.  The first is opioids -- 144 people that died last year as a result of opioid overdose; 31 percent increase over the year before.  We need help.  Eighty-plus percent of the drugs come from south of the border.  Everybody knows it.  I know you will do something about it.THE PRESIDENT:  I will.  It's already being done, believe me.  It's a big, big difference.  And we will do that, and you do have a big problem, and you have a big problem with the refugees pouring in, don't you?SHERIFF STANEK:  Yes, we do, sir.  And we all asking if what you're doing, which is let the courts decide, do what we've been doing.  Rule of law is strong and the proper vetting of individuals is really important to us.THE PRESIDENT:  Well, you know, the vetting is much, much tougher now.  And we need this court case.  It will be very helpful to keeping the wrong people out of our country.  You understand that better than anybody.  So I think we're going to have some good results.SHERIFF STANEK:  I do, sir.THE PRESIDENT:  It may take a little while.  And you know, this is a very dangerous period of time because while everybody is talking and dealing, a lot of bad people are thinking about, hey, let's go in right now.  But we're being very, very tough with the vetting -- tougher than ever before.SHERIFF STANEK:  Sir, I chaired the Homeland Security Committee for the National Sheriffs' Association.  We heard from General Kelly yesterday, his message was right on the mark about carrying out your directives, and we appreciate that. THE PRESIDENT:  That used to be a political position, you know, what General Kelly is doing here right now.  Homeland Security, if you remember -- it's like a political position.  Not anymore.  Now it's, in my opinion, one of truly most important positions.  So he's doing a great job.  Thank you very much.SHERIFF STANEK:  Thank you, sir.THE PRESIDENT:  Yes, sir.SHERIFF GLICK:  Mr. President, thank you.  It's such an honor to be here.  I'm Danny Glick, sheriff of Laramie County, Wyoming.  You know, there are so many issues that you'll hear going around this table.  One of the ones that probably isn't -- that people don't realize is EPA decisions that have affected our coal industry, our oil industry in the West.  But beyond that, it increases the number of people that are jobless and thus increases our crime statistics.  And it's starting to overwhelm us.  We're very small out there for the most part, and we don't have the numbers of deputies, officers and law enforcement that can sometimes keep up with this.  I appreciate what you've done and what you're planning in the future.  I think it was very well publicized, and I just appreciate being here today.THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Sheriff.  And I will tell you that the EPA -- you're right.  I call it -- it's clogged the bloodstream of our country.  People can't do anything.  People are looking to get approvals for factories for 15 years, and then after the 15th year they get voted down after having spent a fortune.  So that's going to end.  We have one of our really great people -- as you know, Scott is looking to be approved by the Senate.  We're still waiting for that one, too.  It's a disgrace what's going on.  But as soon as he gets involved, we're going to unclog the system.And, by the way, people are going to get rejected, but they're going to get rejected quickly.  But for the most part, they're going to be accepted when they want to do.  We're going to bring the jobs back.  And your state was very, very good to me, as you know.  I mean, they were very, very good to me and I appreciate that.  And just tell the people we're going to get the system unclogged and we're going to get it up.  As you know, I approved two pipelines that were stuck in limbo forever.  I don't even think it was controversial.  You know, I approved them -- I haven't even heard -- I haven't had one call from anybody saying, oh, that was a terrible thing you did.  I haven't had one call.  You know, usually, if I do something it's like bedlam, right?  I haven't had one call from anybody.  And a lot of jobs -- in the Keystone case, we have potentially 32,000 jobs almost immediately.  And then, as you know, I did the Dakota pipeline and nobody called up to complain.  Because it was unfair.  Years of getting approvals, nobody showed up to fight it.  This company spends a tremendous -- hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars, and then all of a sudden, people show up to fight it.  It's not fair to our companies.  And I think everyone is going to be happy in the end, okay?So I appreciate it very much, Sheriff.  It's a great honor to have you here.  Thank you.  And say hello to your people.Yes, sir.SHERIFF LAYTON:  Good morning, Mr. President.  I'm John Layton.  I'm the sheriff of Marion County, Indiana, which is -- (laughter) -- THE PRESIDENT:  You never met our great Vice President.  (Laughter.)SHERIFF LAYTON:  I'm very proud of this man.  And we as sheriffs -- this is, to me, it seems like it's unprecedented.  I look back into the history of the NSA, long before myself, and I never have -- I could never find where -- not only did the President and now the Vice President, as well, has invited us into your house to share some concerns of ours --THE PRESIDENT:  And in about 10 minutes, you're going to see the Oval Office, too, which is -- that's the other thing, you know, people have had meetings here.  I had the car companies, the biggest companies -- Ford, General Motors, Fiat -- and they were in this room often.  And I said, oh, so you've seen the Oval Office?  ""No, we've never been invited to see the Oval Office.""  You know where the Oval Office is?  Ten feet in that direction -- 10 feet.SHERIFF LAYTON:  Looking forward to it.  (Laughter.)THE PRESIDENT:  Look, these are the biggest people that were going there -- these are the biggest people.  So they were never invited to the Oval Office and they were only 10 feet away.  You would think they would be invited.  But you're going to see the Oval Office, okay?SHERIFF LAYTON:  Thank you, Mr. President.  One of the main concerns was not just my office as sheriff, but across the nation -- the mentally ill in the jails, and the people that they're being really, for lack of a better term, warehoused in our jails across America because we don't have the facilities necessary to take care of them on the outside.  And it ends up a lot of these people go to jail because the public or the police officer happens to be mad at them at the time, instead of they need to be in the jail for a very good reason.  So we just appreciate you having the back of law enforcement.  We do all feel that, as everyone with a badge knows, that you do have our backs and that we're looking forward to years of harmony and taking care of business with the people we serve.THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I appreciate it.  And I will say that, in the recent election, law enforcement is with me.  I mean, the numbers were staggering -- staggering.  It wasn't like, gee, it's 51-49.  Believe me, it was through the roof.  Law enforcement and military also.SHERIFF LAYTON:  Absolutely.THE PRESIDENT:  I think, generally, people in uniform tend to like me.  (Laughter.)  Explain that to me.  Dana, explain that to me.  (Laughter.)  So, Sheriff, thank you very much.  And do you miss your former governor?SHERIFF LAYTON:  We do, we do.THE PRESIDENT:  You have a good new governor.SHERIFF LAYTON:  Holcomb is holding down the fort for us, though, but big shoes for him to fill.THE PRESIDENT:  Mike Pence has been fantastic.SHERIFF LAYTON:  Yes, he has.THE PRESIDENT:  Dana, I want to thank you for your service.  Amazing the way you just stepped into the breach and have done such a good job.  And let's see what happens with the court case.MR. BOENTE:  Well, Mr. President, thank you for the privilege to serve you and the Department of Justice and the American people.  I'm very honored by it.  And I want to thank all the sheriffs here, but I guess our local and state partners -- it's very important to federal law enforcement and all the agencies.  And I know that Senator Sessions -- we're looking forward to him getting to the Department -- will make that an important priority.  And he wants to strengthen that bond that we have with them because it's very, very important to law enforcement.THE PRESIDENT:  Yes, well, thank you very much.  And, you know, one of the things that you know better than anybody is that we had a very good victory in Boston.  So I said to everybody, why don’t we use the Boston case?  Why aren’t we using the Boston case?  Because the Boston victory was great, but it's statutorily --MR. BOENTE:  Judge Gordon, who wrote that decision, had a very good analysis where he referred to immigration law, and I thought it was a terrific opinion.  And I think it’s the right opinion.  THE PRESIDENT:  And a highly respected judge, too.  So I appreciate it.  Thank you, Dana, very much.  Appreciate it.  SHERIFF PAGE:  Mr. President, I’m Sheriff Page from Rockingham County, North Carolina.  And you did very well in North Carolina.  (Laughter.)  And I just want to --THE PRESIDENT:  Go North Carolina.SHERIFF PAGE:  Hey!  (Laughter.)  And I just want to say that we appreciate you being where you’re at.  The first responsibility of government is protecting its people.  As we as elected by the people and you’re elected by the people, we got that.  When you say there's a new sheriff in town, we relate to that.  You’re about the rule of law.  We haven’t seen that in many years, and we appreciate that.And I want to tell you something -- when General Kelly was speaking yesterday for the sheriffs, he made -- he was telling us about -- he went -- I saw something that I haven’t seen before. He went to the border, he looked at the assets, and he asked the law enforcement down there, what’s going on and what can we do to help fix the situation down here.  So you’ve got a good team.  You’re putting together a good team.  You’ve got the support of sheriffs from across the country, and we appreciate what you’re doing.THE PRESIDENT:  Well, thank you.  And a funny story -- so when General Kelly was just sworn in, now Secretary Kelly, and I said, you want to have dinner tonight and we’ll talk?  “Sir, I’m heading to the border.”  I said, I like that better.  (Laughter.)  We don’t need to eat.  I said, I like that better.  So he’s right on the ball, he’s going to be fantastic.  Because everybody has said the same thing.  Thank you.  That’s very nice. SHERIFF PAGE:  Thank you, sir.SHERIFF MAHONEY:  Good morning, Mr. President.  Dave Mahoney, I’m the sheriff in Dane County, which is Madison, Wisconsin.  I want to thank you for inviting our nation’s sheriffs into the White House.  You know, as the only elected law enforcement leaders in our community, we are the most engaged in our community's issues and concerns.  And I think it’s important.  I think there’s a strong message when the President of the United States invites our nation’s sheriffs in to talk about those issues that are of importance in our community.THE PRESIDENT:  Has this ever happened before with the sheriffs?PARTICIPANT:  No, sir.PARTICIPANT:  No, sir.    THE PRESIDENT:  It never happened?PARTICIPANT:  Never.  THE PRESIDENT:  And yet the murder rate in our country is the highest it’s been in 47 years, right?  Did you know that?  Forty-seven years.  I used to use that -- I’d say that in a speech and everybody was surprised, because the press doesn’t tell it like it is.  It wasn’t to their advantage to say that.  But the murder rate is the highest it’s been in, I guess, from 45 to 47 years.  And you would think that you would be invited here, and you would think that you people would be able to solve -- had you -- if you ran Chicago, you would solve that nightmare, I tell you.  I’ll bet everybody in that room, especially Carolyn, right, would raise their hand.  Because to allow -- I mean, literally -- hundreds of shootings a month, it’s worse than some of the places that we read about in the Middle East, where you have wars going on.  It’s so sad.  Chicago has become so sad a situation. SHERIFF MAHONEY:  I’m only three hours from downtown Chicago, and as Sheriff Stanek mentioned, the issues of heroin and opiate addiction -- I’m averaging 12, 15 overdoses a week in my community.  And we need help from DEA, FBI, and our task forces.  We need them to be adequately funded and led by leaders who want to work collectively with our nation’s sheriffs.THE PRESIDENT:  How much of your crime is caused, do you think, by drugs generally?SHERIFF MAHONEY:  Eighty percent?  THE PRESIDENT:  Eighty percent.  So without drugs, you would have a whole different ballgame.  SHERIFF MAHONEY:  I have a jail, over 1,000 beds.  Eighty percent suffer from chronic drug and alcohol addiction.THE PRESIDENT:  And when did it start, big league?  Or has it been going on for many years?SHERIFF MAHONEY:  Well, I think heroin and opiates have overshadowed cocaine, which of course has been, since the eighties, our number-one drug of choice.  Now it’s prescription painkillers and --THE PRESIDENT:  And at a much higher level?SHERIFF MAHONEY:  At a higher level.  THE PRESIDENT:  Much higher.SHERIFF MAHONEY:  The overdoses are at a much higher level. THE PRESIDENT:  Right, right.PARTICIPANT:  Mr. President, I hate to interrupt -- it used to take 90 days to take a load of heroin from the border to get it into the (inaudible) mainstream.  Now it’s taking 14 days.  THE PRESIDENT:  Okay, well, we’ll have it take infinity, okay?  (Laughter.)  SHERIFF MAHONEY:  I want to thank you too for seeking the input and guidance of our nation’s sheriffs on issues like immigration.  My community is looking for immigration reform, an expedited way for a good immigrant to obtain citizenship in this great country.  And I appreciate the invitation today to join you, and look forward to working with you on many of these issues.  Some we’ll disagree on, but far more we’re going to agree on.THE PRESIDENT:  Absolutely, you’re right.  I actually can’t believe that we’re having to fight to protect the security -- in a court system to protect the security of our nation.  I can’t even believe it.  And a lot of people agree with us, believe me.  There’s a group of people out there -- and I mean much more than half of our country -- much, much more.  You’re not allowed to use the term “silent majority” anymore.  You’re not allowed, because they make that into a whole big deal.  But there’s a group of people out there -- massive, massive numbers, far bigger than what you see protesting.  And if those people ever protested, you would see a real protest.  But they want to see our borders secure and our country secure, and they want to see people that can love our country come in, not people that are looking to destroy our country.So anyway, thank you, Sheriff.SHERIFF AUBREY:  Sheriff John Aubrey, fifth-term sheriff, Jefferson County, Kentucky.  Past president of National Sheriffs' Association.  And my fellow sheriffs have brought up a number of points, and I’d like to add two to it that I know are on your plate and the administration’s plate.  The 1033 program, where we were sharing Department of Defense surplus material that helps us in our war.  They were used in the war, and they helped us in our war.  That got severely curtailed.  And the other thing is asset forfeiture.  People want to say we’re taking money and without due process.  That’s not true.  We take money from dope dealers --THE PRESIDENT:  So you’re saying -- okay, so you’re saying the asset-taking you used to do, and it had an impact, right?  And you’re not allowed to do it now?SHERIFF AUBREY:  No, they have curtailed it a little bit.  And I’m sure the folks are --THE PRESIDENT:  And that’s for legal reasons?  Or just political reasons?  SHERIFF AUBREY:  They make it political and they make it -- they make up stories.  All you’ve got to do --THE PRESIDENT:  I’d like to look into that, okay?  There’s no reason for that.  Dana, do you think there’s any reason for that?  Are you aware of this?MR. BOENTE:  I am aware of that, Mr. President.  And we have gotten a great deal of criticism for the asset forfeiture, which, as the sheriff said, frequently was taking narcotics proceeds and other proceeds of crime.  But there has been a lot of pressure on the department to curtail some of that.THE PRESIDENT:  So what do you do?  So in other words, they have a huge stash of drugs.  So in the old days, you take it.  Now we’re criticized if we take it.  So who gets it?  What happens to it?  Tell them to keep it?MR. BOENTE:  Well, we have what is called equitable sharing, where we usually share it with the local police departments for whatever portion that they worked on the case.  And it was a very successful program, very popular with the law enforcement community.  THE PRESIDENT:  And now what happens?MR. BOENTE:  Well, now we’ve just been given -- there’s been a lot of pressure not to forfeit, in some cases.THE PRESIDENT:  Who would want that pressure, other than, like, bad people, right?  But who would want that pressure?  You would think they’d want this stuff taken away.SHERIFF AUBREY:  You have to be careful how you speak, I guess.  But a lot of pressure is coming out of -- was coming out of Congress.  I don’t know that that will continue now or not.THE PRESIDENT:  I think less so.  I think Congress is going to get beat up really badly by the voters because they've let this happen.  And I think badly.  I think you'll be back in shape.  So, asset forfeiture, we're going to go back on, okay?SHERIFF AUBREY:  Thank you, sir.  THE PRESIDENT:  I mean, how simple can anything be?  You all agree with that, I assume, right?PARTICIPANT:  Absolutely, yeah.  THE PRESIDENT:  Do you even understand the other side of it?PARTICIPANT:  No.  THE PRESIDENT:  It's like some things --PARTICIPANT:  No sense.THE PRESIDENT:  Sort of like the Iran deal.  Nobody even understands how a thing like that could have happened.  It does nothing.PARTICIPANT:  You shouldn’t be allowed to profit from the illegal proceeds.  So if you're going to sell narcotics and sell illegal drugs in our country, you also cannot profit from that.  And so we seize those profits.THE PRESIDENT:  So do we need any legislation or any executive orders for that, would you say, Dana -- to put that back in business?MR. BOENTE:  I don’t think we need any executive orders.  We just need kind of some encouragement to move in that direction.THE PRESIDENT:  Okay.  Good.  You're in charge.  (Laughter.)  I love that answer, because it's better than signing executive orders and then these people take it and they make it look so terrible -- ""oh, it's so terrible.""  I love it.  You're encouraged.  PARTICIPANT:  Thank you.THE PRESIDENT:  Good.  Asset forfeiture.  You're encouraged.  Okay.  Yes, sir.MR. BITTICK:  Mr. President, we appreciate you having us here today at the White House.  My name is John Cary Bittick, and I'm a sheriff in Monroe County, Georgia.  And I'm a past president of the National Sheriffs Association, as well.  And I currently chair our governmental affairs committee.  And I just want to thank you for the administration working actually on pieces of legislation and on political ideas with us.  It's refreshing, and we are thoroughly enjoying it.  We are currently working with Senator Grassley on some criminal justice reform issues.  And the administration has been supporting us.  And asset forfeiture is a big thing.THE PRESIDENT:  Okay, go for it.  Just go for it.  Dana will tell me if I can't or if -- (laughter) --  MR. BITTICK:  Yes, sir.  I think they got that message. THE PRESIDENT:  Okay, that's great.MR. BITTICK:  But we appreciate it, and we appreciate your ear.  And we appreciate you taking the time to sit down and at least talk to us.THE PRESIDENT:  I appreciate it too.  Thank you, John.MR. BITTICK:  Thanks for your support.THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  SHERIFF CHAMPAGNE:  Thank you, Mr. President, Mr. Vice President.  Greg Champagne, I am sheriff in St. Charles Parish, Louisiana, basically a suburban community outside of New Orleans.  I have the honor of representing 3,088 sheriffs around the country.  And you see the leadership of our organization.  These are the leadership of past presidents and the future presidents of our agency.  But more importantly than that, we all represent and oversee literally a few hundred thousand deputy sheriffs who are truly the backbone of law enforcement in this country.  We have a bumper sticker the NSA puts out that says, ""Sheriffs and deputies:  The original homeland security.""  And so that is a force-multiplier.Those men and women out there are the tip of the spear, and we stand ready to help and keep this community safe, because that's what we're all elected to do.  So we thank you so much for having us.THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  You're a great group of people.We're going to go into the Oval Office.  Does anybody have anything to -- not even a question, a statement, as to how we can bring about law enforcement in a very good, civil, lovely way, but we have to stop crime -- right?  Would anybody like to make a statement?PARTICIPANT:  Mr. President, on asset forfeiture, we got a state senator in Texas who was talking about introducing legislation to require conviction before we can receive their forfeiture.THE PRESIDENT:  Can you believe that?PARTICIPANT:  And I told him that the cartel would build a monument to him in Mexico if he could get that legislation.THE PRESIDENT:  Who is the state senator?  Want to give his name?  We'll destroy his career.  (Laughter.)  Okay, thank you.PARTICIPANT:  Mr. President, we have been invited to the White House before.  We've sat at this table with the former administration.  This is totally different.  Not once did the President go around the room and ask the sheriffs what were issues that were important to us, he or she, in our parts of the country, but rather it was an outgoing message about gun control, about other things.  You asked us what is important to us, whether it's mental health in the jails, opioid addiction.  You hit it right off the bat.  The border, immigration, vetting.  We appreciate that.  That has not happened before.  We've been here before, but we've never had a President sit down and listen to what it is that we're facing representing our constituents and public safety across this country.  And that's why we appreciate it.  That's why we're here today. THE PRESIDENT:  You know, Bill Belichick, is a great guy, a friend of mine.  And he was telling me -- somebody told me that he'll oftentimes, wanting to get a player, he'll go to the other players on the team -- he'll say, what do you think of this guy?  You know, they all the different people.  And he'll listen to them.  And he's done very well, right?  He's done very well.  And essentially what they're -- we're talking to the people that know -- I'm not telling you, you're telling me.  That came up this morning.  I mean, that was a big statement.  And I didn’t realize it was all clogged.  The system is all clogged.  So we're going to unclog the system, and we're going to go right now into the Oval Office. Would you like the press to come in with you, Mr. Vice President?  Should we let them come in?  Otherwise they're going turn around, waiting for the next meeting for six hours.  They don’t have such an easy job, I'll tell you.  They don’t have such an easy job.  Q    Mr. President, how far are you willing to take your travel ban fight?THE PRESIDENT:  Oh, we're going to take it through the system.  It's very important.  It's very important for the country, regardless of me or whoever succeeds at a later date.  I mean, we have to have security in our country.  We have to have the ability.  When you take some place like Syria, when you take all of the different people pouring -- and if you remember, ISIS said, we are going to infiltrate the United States and other countries through the migration.  And then we're not allowed to be tough on the people coming in?  Explain that one.  So we'll see what happens.  We have big court case.  We're well-represented.  And we're going to see what happens.Q    Is it going to go to the Supreme Court, you think?THE PRESIDENT:  It could.  We will see.  Hopefully it doesn’t have to.  It's common sense.  You know, some things are law, and I'm all in favor of that.  And some things are common sense.  This is common sense.Q    Mr. President, if it's unreported or under-reported -- ""unreported"" is the phrase you used yesterday -- but if it's under-reported, why do you think the media is not reporting, or America is not caring about this type of --THE PRESIDENT:  I have to know, because I'm reported on possibly more than anybody in the world -- I don’t think you have anything to say about that.  I happen to know how dishonest the media is.  I happen to know stories about me that should be good -- or bad -- you know, I don’t mind a bad story if it's true.  But I don’t like bad stories that -- stories that should be a positive story when they make them totally negative.  I understand the total dishonesty of the media better than anybody.  And I let people know it.  I mean, the media is a very, very dishonest arm, and we'll see what happens.  Not everybody.  And I have to say that.  I always preface it by saying, not everybody.  But there's tremendous dishonest -- pure, outright dishonesty from the media.  Let’s go into the Oval Office.(Meeting moves to Oval Office.)THE PRESIDENT:  So they said this is the first President they've ever seen with all the papers on their desk.  (Inaudible) cutting the price of the F-35 fighters.  We have a lot of papers. Okay, go ahead, folks.PARTICIPANT:  Mr. President, on behalf of 3,088 sheriffs in America, there is a new sheriff in town, and it's only fitting that we provide you with our sculpture.  The first time the NSA has provided a sculpture to a non-law enforcement person.  And there is a new sheriff in town -- for you.  THE PRESIDENT:  Thank yo"

It doesn’t get much better than that, right?THE PRESIDENT:  Would you like to --MS. WAGNER:  It's my baby.  (Laughter.)  THE PRESIDENT:  Why don’t you explain this.MS. WAGNER:  What we're doing is we are returning to the American people, low- and middle- income investors, and retirees, their control of their own retirement savings.  This is about Main Street, and it's been a labor of love for me for over four years as chairman.  And I have had -- this is a big day, a big moment for Americans.  (Inaudible.) THE PRESIDENT:  And she means that so much.(Executive order is signed.)THE PRESIDENT:  Chairman, I think we should hand the pen to this very special person.  PARTICIPANT:  Absolutely, Mr. President.  She earned it.  She earned it.  THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.MS. WAGNER:  Thank you.  I'm grateful.Q    Mr. President, do you have anything to say about the decision to make the Iran -- should they be
2017-02-02;https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/02/02/remarks-president-trump-national-prayer-breakfast;Remarks by President Trump at National Prayer Breakfast;"Thank you, Mark.  So nice.  (Applause.)  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  It’s a great honor to be here this morning.  And so many faith leaders -- very, very important people to me -- from across our magnificent nation, and so many leaders from all across the globe.Today we continue a tradition begun by President Eisenhower some 64 years ago.  This gathering is a testament to the power of faith, and is one of the great customs of our nation, and I hope to be here seven more times with you.  (Laughter and applause.)I want very much to thank our co-chairs, Senator Bowzman and Senator Coons, and all of the congressional leadership -- they’re all over the place.  We have a lot of very distinguished guests.  And we have one guest who was just sworn in last night -- Rex Tillerson, Secretary of State.  (Applause.)  Going to do a great job.  Some people didn’t like Rex because he actually got along with leaders of the world.  I said, no, you have to understand, that’s a good thing.  (Laughter.)  That’s a good thing, not a bad thing.  He’s respected all over the world, and I think he’s going to go down as one of our great, great secretaries.  We appreciate it.  Thank you, thank you, Rex.  (Applause.) Thank you as well to Senate Chaplain Barry Black for his moving words.  And I don't know, Chaplain, whether or not that’s an appointed position.  Is that an appointed position?  I don’t even know if you’re a Democrat or if you’re a Republican, but I’m appointing you for another year -- the hell with it.  (Laughter and applause.)  And I think it’s not even my appointment, it’s the Senate’s appointment, but we’ll talk to them.  Your son is here.  Your job is very, very secure, okay?  (Laughter.)  Thank you, Barry.  Appreciate it very much.I also want to thank my great friends, though, Roma.  Where’s Roma?  Beautiful Roma Downey.  The voice of an angel.  She’s got the voice -- every time I hear it, that voice is so beautiful.  Everything is so beautiful about Roma, including her husband because he’s a special, special friend, Mark Burnett -- for the wonderful introduction.  So true.  So true.  I said to the agent, I’m sorry.  The only thing more -- I actually got on the phone and fired him myself because he said, you don’t want to do it, it’ll never work, it’ll never, ever work.  You don’t want to do it.  I said, listen -- but I really fired him after it became the number-one show.  It became so successful, and he wanted a commission, and he didn’t want to do it.  That’s what I really said.  (Laughter.) But we had tremendous success on ""The Apprentice.""  And when I ran for President, I had to leave the show.  That’s when I knew for sure I was doing it.  And they hired a big, big movie star -- Arnold Schwarzenegger -– to take my place.  And we know how that turned out.  (Laughter.)  The ratings went right down the tubes.  It’s been a total disaster.  And Mark will never, ever bet against Trump again.  And I want to just pray for Arnold, if we can, for those ratings, okay?  (Laughter.) But we’ve had an amazing life together, the last 14, 15 years.  And an outstanding man, and thank you very much for introducing me.  Appreciate it.  It’s a great honor.  (Applause.) I also want to thank my dear friend, Vice President Mike Pence, who has been incredible.  (Applause.)  And incredible wife, Karen.  And every time I was in a little trouble with something, where they were questioning me, they’d say, but he picked Mike Pence -- (laughter) -- so he has to know what he’s doing.  And it’s true, he’s been -- you know, on the scale of 0 to 10, I rate him a 12, okay?  So I want to thank you.  Thank you very much.  Apprentice it.  (Applause.) But most importantly today, I want to thank the American people.  Your faith and prayers have sustained me and inspired me through some very, very tough times.  All around America, I have met amazing people whose words of worship and encouragement have been a constant source of strength.  What I hear most often as I travel the country are five words that never, ever fail to touch my heart.  That’s:  “I am praying for you.”  I hear it so often -- “I am praying for you, Mr. President.”  (Applause.)  No one has inspired me more in my travels than the families of the United States military, men and women who have put their lives on the line every day for their country and their countrymen.  I just came back yesterday from Dover Air Force Base to join the family of Chief William “Ryan” Owens, as America’s fallen hero was returned home.  Very, very sad, but very, very beautiful.  Very, very beautiful.  His family was there.  Incredible family, loved him so much.  So devastated -- he was so devastated.  But the ceremony was amazing.  He died in defense of our nation.  He gave his life in defense of our people.  Our debt to him and our debt to his family is eternal and everlasting.“Greater love hath no man than this: that a man lay down his life for his friends.”  We will never forget the men and women who wear the uniform, believe me.  (Applause.)  Thank you.  From generation to generation, their vigilance has kept our liberty alive.  Our freedom is won by their sacrifice, and our security has been earned with their sweat and blood and tears.  God has blessed this land to give us such incredible heroes and patriots.  They are very, very special, and we are going to take care of them.  (Applause.)  Our soldiers understand that what matters is not party or ideology or creed, but the bonds of loyalty that link us all together as one.  America is a nation of believers.  In towns all across our land, it’s plain to see what we easily forget -- so easily we forget this -- that the quality of our lives is not defined by our material success, but by our spiritual success.  I will tell you that.  And I tell you that from somebody that has had material success and knows tremendous numbers of people with great material success -- the most material success.  Many of those people are very, very miserable, unhappy people.  And I know a lot of people without that, but they have great families, they have great faith.  They don’t have money -- at least not nearly to the extent -- and they’re happy.  Those to me are the successful people, I have to tell you.  (Applause.)I was blessed to be raised in a churched home.  My mother and father taught me that to whom much is given much is expected.  I was sworn in on the very bible from which my mother would teach us as young children.  And that faith lives on in my heart every single day.The people in this room come from many, many backgrounds.  You represent so many religions and so many views.  But we are all united by our faith in our Creator and our firm knowledge that we are all equal in His eyes.  We are not just flesh and bone and blood.  We are human beings, with souls.  Our Republic was formed on the basis that freedom is not a gift from government, but that freedom is a gift from God.  (Applause.)  It was the great Thomas Jefferson who said, “The God who gave us life, gave us liberty.”  Jefferson asked, “Can the liberties of a nation be secure when we have removed a conviction that these liberties are the gift of God?”Among those freedoms is the right to worship according to our own beliefs.  That is why I will get rid of, and totally destroy, the Johnson Amendment and allow our representatives of faith to speak freely and without fear of retribution.  I will do that -- remember.  (Applause.)  Freedom of religion is a sacred right, but it is also a right under threat all around us, and the world is under serious, serious threat in so many different ways.  And I've never seen it so much and so openly as since I took the position of President.  The world is in trouble, but we're going to straighten it out.  Okay?  That's what I do.  I fix things.  We're going to straighten it out.  (Applause.)  Believe me.  When you hear about the tough phone calls I'm having, don’t worry about it.  Just don’t worry about it.  (Laughter.)  They're tough.  We have to be tough.  It's time we're going to be a little tough, folks.  We're taken advantage of by every nation in the world, virtually.  It's not going to happen anymore.  It's not going to happen anymore.We have seen unimaginable violence carried out in the name of religion.  Acts of wanton slaughter against religious minorities.  Horrors on a scale that defy description.  Terrorism is a fundamental threat to religious freedom.  It must be stopped, and it will be stopped.  It may not be pretty for a little while.  It will be stopped.  (Applause.)  We have seen -- and, by the way, General, as you know, James ""Mad Dog"" -- I shouldn’t say it in this room -- Mattis.  Now, there's a reason they call him ""Mad Dog Mattis"" -- he never lost a battle.  Always wins them and always wins them fast.  He's our new Secretary of Defense who will be working with Rex.  He's right now in South Korea, going to Japan, going to some other spots.  And I'll tell you what, I've gotten to know him really well.  He's the real deal.  We have somebody who's the real deal working for us, and that's what we need.  So, you watch.  You just watch.  (Applause.)  Things will be different. We have seen peace-loving Muslims brutalized, victimized, murdered and oppressed by ISIS killers.  We have seen threats of extermination against the Jewish people.  We have seen a campaign of ISIS and genocide against Christians, where they cut off heads.  Not since the Middle Ages have we seen that.  We haven’t seen that, the cutting off of heads.  Now they cut off their heads, they drown people in steel cages.  Haven’t seen this -- I haven’t seen this.  Nobody has seen this for many, many years. All nations have a moral obligation to speak out against such violence.  All nations have a duty to work together to confront it and to confront it viciously, if we have to.  So I want to express clearly today to the American people that my administration will do everything in its power to defend and protect religious liberty in our land.  America must forever remain a tolerant society where all faiths are respected, and where all of our citizens can feel safe and secure.  We have to feel safe and secure.In recent days, we have begun to take necessary action to achieve that goal.  Our nation has the most generous immigration system in the world.  But these are those and there are those that would exploit that generosity to undermine the values that we hold so dear.  We need security.  There are those who would seek to enter our country for the purpose of spreading violence or oppressing other people based upon their faith or their lifestyle.  Not right.  We will not allow a beachhead of intolerance to spread in our nation.  You look all over the world and you see what's happening.So in the coming days, we will develop a system to help ensure that those admitted into our country fully embrace our values of religious and personal liberty, and that they reject any form of oppression and discrimination.  We want people to come into our nation, but we want people to love us and to love our values -- not to hate us and to hate our values.  We will be a safe country.  We will be a free country.  And we will be a country where all citizens can practice their beliefs without fear of hostility or fear of violence.  America will flourish as long as our liberty and, in particular, our religious liberty is allowed to flourish.  (Applause.)America will succeed as long as our most vulnerable citizens -- and we have some that are so vulnerable -- have a path to success.  And America will thrive as long as we continue to have faith in each other and faith in God.  (Applause.)That faith in God has inspired men and women to sacrifice for the needy, to deploy to wars overseas, and to lock arms at home, to ensure equal rights for every man, woman and child in our land.  It's that faith that sent the pilgrims across the oceans, the pioneers across the plains, and the young people all across America to chase their dreams.  They are chasing their dreams.  We are going to bring those dreams back.  As long as we have God, we are never, ever alone.  Whether it's the soldier on the night watch or the single parent on the night shift, God will always give us solace and strength and comfort.We need to carry on and to keep carrying on.  For us here in Washington, we must never, ever stop asking God for the wisdom to serve the public according to his will.  That's why -- (applause) -- thank you.  That's why President Eisenhower and Senator Carlson had the wisdom to gather together 64 years ago to begin this truly great tradition.  But that's not all they did together.  Let me tell you the rest of the story.  Just one year later, Senator Carlson was among the members of Congress to send to the President's desk a joint resolution that added ""under God"" to our Pledge of Allegiance.  That's a great thing.  (Applause.)  Because that's what we are and that is what we will always be, and that is what our people want:  one beautiful nation, under God.  Thank you.  God bless you.  And God bless America.

(Laughter.)  MR. COLLAMORE:  More than one.THE PRESIDENT:  I have a lot of them.  I have a lot.  You've been great friends and supporters and appreciated for, number one, the election.  And I appreciate all of the help in deciding who to pick for the United States Supreme Court.  And, Leonard, you were fantastic.  All of you were.  And Jim DeMint -- I don't know if Jim is here or not but they were great, Heritage.  You really did.  You really helped.  And the rollout has been fantastic.  I don't know how anybody can oppose him, frankly.  I don't know how anybody can oppose him at all, but it really has been a beautiful thing to see.  So we had a very successful event.  He's a terrific person, by the way.  I got to know him reasonably well before we did the announcement, and he is just a spectacular man.  I think he will be a spectacular -- you know, you tell me, how would they go about -- Leonard, how would they go about opposing him?  He's perfect in almost every way.  But they'll look for the ""almost,"" right?  They'll say, what's the ""almost?""  MR. LEO:  He's got an impeccable record.THE PRESIDENT:  Well, Federalist really -- they really did a great job.  So we're going to be talking about working with the judge and maybe making this a fast process.  And nominating a justice of the Supreme Court is one of the most important things that I can do as President.  I've always said this -- as I watched Presidents -- I'd say the most important thing.  And I think I want to refine that a little bit.  I think probably defense of our country might be now -- you know, it's -- otherwise we don't need the Supreme Court so badly, right?  We're doing well in that regard, very well.  I think we have problems that are a lot bigger than people understood.  I think I was left something isn't -- had a lot of problems, but I think we'll straighten out those problems.  I think we'll straight them out very strongly.  Judge Gorsuch is an exceptionally qualified person from the standpoint of experience and education.  Columbia with honors, Harvard Law School with honors, Oxford at the highest level.  Great, great student, great intellect.  Supreme Court Justices White and Kennedy he clerked.  And so I just think it's really great that we're having this meeting, because we want to have him go through an elegant process as opposed to a demeaning process.  Because they're very demeaning on the other side and they want to make you look as bad as possible.  And, of course, the press can be very demeaning too, but I'm sure the press will be very dignified in this case.But I really want -- that's the word -- I really think he's a very dignified man.  I'd like to see him go through a dignified process.  I think he deserves that.  And hopefully it will go quickly and we'll see what happens.So what we might do is -- just before they leave -- we might ask for the folks in the room just to give yourself a quick -- your name and a little introduction.  And, Wayne, I would say they know you.  Perhaps they know you better than they know me.  (Laughter.)MR. LAPIERRE:  I doubt that.  Wayne LaPierre, National Rifle Association.MS. NANCE:  I'm Penny Nance.  I'm the CEO and president of Concerned Women for America.MS. YOEST:  I'm Charmaine Yoest.  I'm with American Values and thank you, Mr. President, for this nomination.THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.MS. DUGGAN:  I'm Juanita Duggan with the National Independent Business Association, NFIB.  Thank you.  MR. COLLAMORE:  Tom Collamore with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.  Mr. President, congratulations on the fantastic nomination.  THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  Thank you.MR. NORQUIST:  Grover Norquist, Americans for Tax Reform.  And thank you for winning the election.THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.MR. LEO:  Leonard Leo, the Federalist Society.MS. DANNENFELSER:  Margorie Dannenfelser, the Susan B. Anthony List.MR. BLACKWELL:  Morton Blackwell, the Leadership Institute.MR. O'STEEN:  David O'Steen, National Right to Life.  Thank you for such a quick, expert nomination.THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  Thank you very much.MS. WHITE:  Paula White, Chairman of the Evangelical Advisory Council.THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Paula.  Thank you for the help during the campaign.So, with that, I'll ask you to all hit the road.  (Laughter.)Q    Mr. President, as you pointed out last night, the judge was confirmed on a unanimous voice.  Well, he's -- can I ask a question, Mr. President?  You all right?  Thank you.  As you pointed out last night, Judge Gorsuch was confirmed on a unanimous voice vote in 2006.  Now, a number of Democrats say they are going to oppose him.  What would you say to those Democrats?  And would you encourage Senator McConnell to invoke the nuclear option if he feels he can't get 60 votes?THE PRESIDENT:  I think there's a certain dishonesty if they go against their vote from not very long ago.  And he did get a unanimous endorsement, and he's somebody that should get it.  I mean, you can't do better from an educational, from an experience, from any standpoint.  A great judge; he'll be a great justice.  So, no, I feel that it's very dishonest if they go about doing that.  And, yes, if we end up with the same gridlock that they've had in Washington for the last -- longer than eight years, in all fairness to President Obama, a lot longer than eight years -- but if we end up with that gridlock, I would say, if you can, Mitch, go nuclear.  Because that would be a absolute shame if a man of this quality was caught up in the web.  So I wo"
2017-02-01;https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/02/01/remarks-president-trump-african-american-history-month-listening-session;Remarks by President Trump in African American History Month Listening Session;ack History Month, so this is our little breakfast, our little get-together.  Hi, Lynne, how are you?  MS. PATTON:  Hi, how are you?THE PRESIDENT:  Nice to see you.  And just a few notes.  During this month, we honor the tremendous history of the African Americans throughout our country -- throughout the world, if you really think about it, right?  And their story is one of unimaginable sacrifice, hard work and faith in America.I’ve gotten a real glimpse -- during the campaign, I’d go around with Ben to a lot of different places that I wasn’t so familiar with.  They’re incredible people.  And I want to thank Ben Carson, who’s going to be heading up HUD.  It’s a big job, and it’s a job that’s not only housing, it’s mind and spirit, right, Ben?  And you understand that.  Nobody is going to be better than Ben.Last month, we celebrated the life of the Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr., whose incredible example is unique in American history.  You read all about Dr. Martin Luther King a week ago when somebody said I took the statue out of my office, and it turned out that that was fake news.  (Laughter.)  It was fake news.  The statue is cherished.  It’s one of the favorite things in the -- and we have some good ones.  We have Lincoln and we have Jefferson and we have Dr. Martin Luther King, and we have -- but they said the statue, the bust of Dr. Martin Luther King was taken out of the office.  And it was never even touched.  So I think it was a disgrace, but that’s the way the press is.  Very unfortunate.I am very proud now that we have a museum on the National Mall where people can learn about Reverend King, so many other things.  Frederick Douglass is an example of somebody who’s done an amazing job and is being recognized more and more, I notice -- Harriet Tubman, Rosa Parks, and millions more black Americans who made America what it is today.  Big impact.I am proud to honor this heritage, and we’ll be honoring it more and more.  The folks at the table in almost all cases have been great friends and supporters.  And Darrell -- I met Darrell when he was defending me on television.  (Laughter.)  And the people that were on the other side of the argument didn’t have a chance, right?  And Paris has done an amazing job in a very hostile CNN community.  (Laughter.)  He’s all by himself -- seven people and Paris.  So I’ll take Paris over the seven.  (Laughter.)  But I don’t watch CNN so I don’t get to see you as much as I want to.  (Laughter.)  I don’t like watching fake news.PARTICIPANT:  None of us watch it either anymore.THE PRESIDENT:  But Fox has treated me very nice -- wherever Fox is, thank you.  We’re going to need better schools, and we need them soon.  We need more jobs, we need better wages -- a lot better wages.  We’re going to work very hard on the inner city.  Ben is going to be doing that big league.  It’s one of his big things that we’re going to be looking at.We need safer communities, and we’re going to do that with law enforcement.  We’re going to make it safe.  We’re going to make it much better than it is right now.  Right now it’s terrible, and I saw you talking about it the other night, Paris, on something else that was really -- you did a fantastic job the other night on a very unrelated show.  I’m ready to do my part -- it’s the only time I can see him.  I’m ready to do my part, and I will say this:  We’re going to work together.  This is a great group.  This is a group that’s been so special to me.  You really helped me a lot.  If you remember, I wasn’t going to do well with the African American community, and after they heard me speaking and talking about the inner city and lots of other things, we ended up getting -- I won’t go into details, but we ended up getting substantially more than other candidates who had run in the past years.  And now, we’re going to take that to new levels.I want to thank my television star over here.  (Laughter.)  Omarosa is actually a very nice person.  Nobody knows that, but -- (laughter) -- I don’t want to destroy her reputation.  She is a very good person and she’s been helpful right from the beginning of the campaign.  And I appreciate it.  I really do.  Very special.And so I want to thank everybody for being here.  Could we maybe just go around the room and we’ll introduce ourselves.  And the press can stay for that, and I’m sure they have no questions about last night because it was such a good launch.  We have a fantastic, hopefully, new justice of the Supreme Court.  And hopefully, that will be -- he’ll be approved very, very quickly.  He’s outstanding in every way -- academically.  He’s done almost as well as you did, Darrell, in college.  (Laughter.)  Not quite, right?  But he’s a great man and I think he’ll be a great, great justice.  And he’s being very well-received.  It was a big evening.  Very big evening.So, Paris, why don’t we start with you?  Go ahead.MR. DENNARD:  Pleasure to be here, Mr. President.  Honor to be here.  Paris Dennard.  Thurgood Marshall College Fund represents the 47 publically supported historically black colleges and universities, which I know you are very much in support of.  So it’s a pleasure to be here, sir.THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I’m glad you’re in support of me because I’d be all -- I’d be in the wilderness without you guys.  You are so effective.  I appreciate it.MR. DENNARD:  Thank you.THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.MR. CLEVELAND:  Bill Cleveland.  I'm a retired Capitol police officer, former vice mayor of the city of Alexandria, and substitute teacher in the Alexandria school system.  Glad to be here.THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  Thank you.MR. MATTHEWS:  Bill is also a Vietnam veteran, sir.  THE PRESIDENT:  Oh, good.  MR. MATTHEWS:  I’m Earl Matthews, sir.  I work for you at the Department of Defense.  I was sworn in an hour after you were.  Also a veteran and a longtime supporter of yours.  I've worked for you since late summer.  I'm happy to be here.  THE PRESIDENT:  Lieutenant Colonel -- good job.  MS. SCOTT:  I'm Belinda Scott, Darrell's wife.  New Spirit Revival Center from Cleveland, Ohio.  Pastor of New Spirit.  Great amount of support in the African American community where we are.  We love the Lord, we love our new President, and we are praying for our President on a regular basis.  THE PRESIDENT:  You know, the one thing I didn't understand about Belinda -- I thought they were married maybe five or six years, because look how they look so young.  (Laughter.)  Should you say how many years you've been married?MS. SCOTT:  Thirty-five.PASTOR SCOTT:  We've been together for 38.MS. SCOTT:  Been together for -- but in the Lord --(laughter) --  35, yes.PASTOR SCOTT:  Two years under -- (inaudible.)  (Laughter.)THE PRESIDENT:  That's actually amazing.  I wouldn't have known.MS. SCOTT:  But can I say this -- I am so grateful that our President gives us that ear to listen to the community -- to listen.  And people like us are just here to constantly put that message out into the community.  And we love you for that.  We love you for listening and we thank you for that.THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  Thank you very much.PASTOR SCOTT:  Darrell Scott, pastor at New Spirit Revival Center and black Trump supporter.  (Laughter and applause.)  But speaking of the community, let me just say this real quick.  Omarosa, I told you I'm going to try to throw it in.  I was recently contacted by some of the top gang thugs initiative Chicago for a sit-down.  They reached out to me because they associated me with you.  They respect you, they believe in what you're doing, and they want to have a sit-down about lowering that body count.  So in a couple of weeks, I'm going into Chicago.THE PRESIDENT:  That's a great idea because Chicago is totally out of control.  PASTOR SCOTT:  Well, I let him know -- I said, we've got to lower that body count.  We don't want to talk about anything else -- get that body count down.  And they agreed.  But the principle is they can do it.  These are guys straight from the streets -- no politicians -- straight street guys.  But they're going to commit that if they lower that body count, we'll come in and we'll do some social programs.  So they're in agreement.THE PRESIDENT:  If they're not going to solve the problem -- and what you're doing is the right thing -- then we're going to solve the problem for them because we're going to have to do something about Chicago.  Because what's happening in Chicago should not be happening in this country.PASTOR SCOTT:  But they want to work with this administration.THE PRESIDENT:  Good.PASTOR SCOTT:  They want to.  They reached out -- I didn't reach out to them.  They reached out to me.THE PRESIDENT:  I understand.PASTOR SCOTT:  They want to work with this administration.  They believe in this administration.  They didn't believe in the prior administration.  They told me this out of their mouth.  But they see hope with you.PRESIDENT TRUMP:  I love it.MR. WILLIAMS:  Mr. President, I'm a member of what we call the media, but we try to be fair and objective.  (Laughter.)  Not all media seems to be the opposition party.  There are those that see the good that you're doing.  We report it.  I'm just honored to have a seat at the table today.THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  And it is -- I mean, a lot of the media is actually the opposition party.  They're so biased and really is a disgrace.  Some of you are fantastic and fair, but so much of the media is opposition party and knowingly saying incorrect things.  So it's a very sad situation.  But we seem to be doing well.  It's almost like, in the meantime, we won.  So maybe they don't have the influence they think, but they really are -- they really have to straighten out their act.  They're very dishonest people.James.PASTOR DAVIS:  Pastor James Davis.  We've been -- Mr. President, we've been a supporter of yours from the beginning alongside Mr. Michael Cohen and Dr. Darrell Scott with the National Diversity Coalition.  It helped to bring out a huge number in the black community with respect to the vote.  And we're still happy to be in support as we go forward.THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  You've been great.  Thank you, James.And, Lynne.MS. PATTON:  Hi, Mr. President.  Yes, I am, as you know, the former vice president of the wonderful charity that your son founded -- Trump Foundation.  I've been with your family for about eight years now, right, Jared?  And I was an RNC speaker and I will be landing with Dr. Carson at HUD as one of his senior advisors --THE PRESIDENT:  Oh, that's great.  You've got a good person.  MS. PATTON:  -- and Director of the Office of Public Liaison.  THE PRESIDENT:  That's great.  You did a fantastic job.MS. PATTON:  Thank you.MR. ROBINSON:  Mr. President, my name is Gerard Robinson.  I'm a resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, and I was proud to be the leader of the education policy team for the Trump transition.THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.MR. BELL:  Mr. President, good to be with you.  I'm Ashley Bell, Gainesville.  Chairman Priebus called me out (inaudible) African American outreach for your campaign.  I'm glad you support Omarosa, glad to be here, and I'll be wanting to help you out at the State Department.THE PRESIDENT:  Fantastic.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.MS. MANIGAULT:  Tucker was a star at the inauguration.MR. DAVIS:  I'm Tucker Davis.  I ran your campaign in West Virginia, working for you in the -- THE PRESIDENT:  We did well in West Virginia.  (Laughter.)MR. DAVIS:  Coal miners love you.THE PRESIDENT:  And we love the coal miners.  We're going to put them back to work.MR. DAVIS:  Absolutely.MS. LEVELL:  Leah LeVell.  I was at the RNC and also at PIC.  And I helped launch the video series every week -- the midweek message that reached out to millennials and college students and helped launch the college Republican chapter at Howard University. MS. MANIGAULT:  That's Chris LeVell's daughter.  We snagged her.  (Laughter.)THE PRESIDENT:  Oh, really?  Great job.MS. ALEXANDER:  Mr. President, Monica Alexander, executive administrative assistant in the office of public liaison, supporting Omarosa.PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Okay, well, that's nice.MR. SMITH:  Mr. President, Ja'Ron Smith.  I'm with the Domestic Policy Council, Andy Bremberg's team, and I'll be focusing on urban affairs and revitalization.  THE PRESIDENT:  Fantastic.MS.
